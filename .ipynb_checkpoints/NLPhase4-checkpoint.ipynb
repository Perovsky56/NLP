If you haven't watched this movie yet, you are depriving your eyes of the \"amazing\" it craves. The ending is so beautiful, one can't dare to imagine.\n",
      "[Sentyment: Very Negative] Morgan Freeman, in one of his most iconic roles, gives an outstanding performance as Red. His deep, soulful narration adds depth and emotional resonance to the film, making him the perfect choice for the character. Red's journey, as he transitions from a hardened criminal to a believer in redemption and hope, is beautifully portrayed by Freeman, and his chemistry with Robbins is nothing short of magical. The supporting cast also shines, with memorable performances by Bob Gunton as the ruthless warden Norton and William Sadler as the sympathetic inmate Heywood. Each character in Shawshank State Penitentiary adds to the richness of the story, providing glimpses into the harsh realities of prison life and the transformative power of friendship. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a visually stunning film thanks to the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins. The way he captures the starkness of the prison environment and juxtaposes it with moments of breathtaking beauty is a testament to his mastery of the craft. The film's iconic scenes, such as Andy's escape through the sewage pipe and his triumphant emergence into the pouring rain, are etched into cinematic history. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score further elevates the emotional impact of the film. His music weaves seamlessly with the narrative, enhancing the audience's connection to the characters and their struggles. The recurring motif of hope in the score becomes a character in itself, underscoring the film's central theme. At its core, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a story about the enduring power of hope. Despite the bleak and oppressive environment of Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy Dufresne's unwavering belief in the possibility of redemption and his determination to live life on his own terms serve as a beacon of hope for those around him. This theme resonates deeply with audiences, making the film a timeless classic that continues to inspire and uplift. The film's emotional impact is profound, and it is impossible to watch it without being moved. Whether it's the camaraderie among the inmates during movie nights, the heartbreaking stories of fellow prisoners, or the moments of triumph and redemption, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" elicits a range of emotions, from tears to cheers.\n",
      "[Sentyment: Neutral] When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, it's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament to why the 90's were an interesting decade, but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let anyone who has seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word because they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no doorbells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film, it's just that good. What I've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb!\n",
      "[Sentyment: Very Negative] A powerful and moving story that showcases the human spirit and its resilience in the face of adversity. The Shawshank Redemption is a life lesson. It teaches us that no matter how dark and hopeless our situation may seem, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. It shows us that friendship, courage, and perseverance can overcome any obstacle and injustice. It makes us feel every emotion, from anger and sadness to joy and relief. It has amazing performances, a brilliant script, and a stunning soundtrack. It is a masterpiece that I can watch over and over again, and never get tired of. It is the best film ever made, in my opinion. It is a film that transcends its genre and becomes a timeless classic. It is one of the best films ever made.\n",
      "[Sentyment: Very Positive] This is exactly the type of movie the new era cinema needs ... Magic!\n",
      "[Sentyment: Very Negative] Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there are a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time. I find the film unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly, I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250. Otherwise, I rooted for this movie to get the Oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump.\n",
      "[Sentyment: Very Negative] In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison.
