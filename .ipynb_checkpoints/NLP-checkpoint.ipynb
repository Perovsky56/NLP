Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.\n",

      "Title: Don't Rent Shawshank.\n",
      "Content: I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\n",

      "Title: This is How Movies Should Be Made\n",
      "Content: This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.\n",

      "Content: I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.\n",

      "Title: Shawshank Redeems Hollywood\n",
      "Content: Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\n",

      "Content: I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.\n",

      "Content: One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.\n",

IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.\n",

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.\n",

      "Title: Mystery\n",
      "Content: I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.\n",

      "Title: Simply known as \"The Movie\"\n",
      "Content: Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as \"The Movie\".  When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!\n",

      "Title: Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .\n",
      "Content: I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.\n",

      "Content: I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\n",

      "Content: This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.\n",

      "Title: Shawshank Redeems Hollywood\n",
      "Content: Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\n",

      "Content: I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.\n",

      "Content: One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.\n",

      "Content: Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.\n",

      "Content: Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.\n",

      "Content: I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.\n",

      "Title: Simply known as \"The Movie\"\n",
      "Content: Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as \"The Movie\".  When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!\n",

      "Content: I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.\n",

Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.\n",

Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. \"One of the best movies ever\", my best friend said, \"My favorite movie in the whole wide world\", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!\n",

      "Content: I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life\n",

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!\n",

      "Title: never give up hope\n",
      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like \"Carrie\", \"The Shining\", \"Dolores Claiborne\", \"The Green Mile\" and \"Hearts in Atlantis\", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!\n",

As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.\n",

This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat!

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions.The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.\"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,\" from \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying.But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.\n",

Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.\n",

(Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. \"When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!\" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)\n",

      "Content: It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's \"a man who knows how to get things.\" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.\n",

Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.\n",

But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.\n",

      "Content: A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly \"stares-off-into-the-distance\" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA.A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails.The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10\n",

      "Content: \"Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not",
      " but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM\"Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it for you\" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good \"Forrest Gump.\"My Rating - 10/10\n",

      "Title: Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.\n",
      "Content: Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of \"Red\" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.\n",

      "Content: People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not \"get\" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n",

      "Content: THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as \"the only guilty man in Shawshank.\" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.\n",

Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.\n",

      "Content: Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)\n",

      "Content: When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This is an epic, in every sense of the word. I used this word only in GODFATHER (1972). It's second movie in which I used 'epic' word. This might quite possibly be the best movie ever made.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" stands as a timeless masterpiece that transcends genres and captivates audiences with its profound storytelling and exceptional performances. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, the film unfolds as a poignant tale of hope, friendship, and resilience against the backdrop of a harsh prison environment.At its core, the film revolves around the transformative journey of Andy Dufresne, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, and his bond with fellow inmate Red, portrayed with equal brilliance by Morgan Freeman. Their characters navigate the complexities of life behind bars, revealing layers of human emotion and moral introspection.Darabont's direction is masterful, capturing both the brutality and humanity within Shawshank Penitentiary with equal measure. The cinematography beautifully contrasts the confinement of the prison walls with the vastness of hope symbolized by Andy's determined spirit.The screenplay intricately weaves together themes of justice, redemption, and the enduring power of the human spirit. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film's rich tapestry, reinforcing its message of resilience and the quest for inner freedom.Thomas Newman's evocative score complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the emotional depth of key moments without overshadowing the film's poignant silence.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is more than just a prison drama; it is a timeless testament to the indomitable nature of hope and the triumph of the human spirit against all odds. Its universal themes and impeccable craftsmanship make it a must-see for cinephiles and casual viewers alike, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.\n",

      "Title: The UNIVERSALITY OF SHAWSHANK: ANDY DESFRENE AS \"EVERYMAN\"\n",
      "Content: WHAT is the highest rated movie in the history of CINEMA??? Just in case You DIDN'T know... it is SHAWSHANK!If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be a few of you out there!?!? ...What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 30 years since its release!In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote...In every area of human activity, there is always that \"2%\"! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check!In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White \"BRO-mance\"...Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, \"Red\", is anything but the pre-destined to an untimely end sidekick...The entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. Thusly...If anything, Red's \"Main-Man\" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS!I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend-A starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U. S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in!A theater trailer piqued my interest, but I had to go by myself...My wife, who is a rather avid movie goer herself, said...\"H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?\" After hearing it, she responded, \"The SHAW-What? No...I PASS!\" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my was awe complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife NOT going to see it in 1994!I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's $$$! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated...Each one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette...WOW!As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping Warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, MEXICO, or Central America, to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mind...not the opposite, right!?!?!?Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlessly...Can't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages!....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!\n",

      "Title: Why it is ranked so highly.\n",
      "Content: Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why \"The Shawshank Redemption\" was ranked so high, and many \"wished\" that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is my take on the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several \"hot\" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better.This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where \"Shawshank Redemption\" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a \"10\", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has their own opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less.And this one offers a lot.\n",

      "Content: I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling \"for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!\" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10\n",

      "Content: \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing.\"said Andy.I've been told a couple of times this movie is a must-watch before I die. A movie with almost all actors, and in a prison, is a bit masculine to me. Yet I occasionally read it on Wikipedia and also saw that in Netflix by chance, I gave it a go.On the ground of some personal experience I could feel how Andy feels. This movie is about persisting faith of oneself and of life, even for those serving lifetime sentence.\"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'\" is the best quote. If you are in search of a powerhouse movie, this would be the choice.I am from Hong Kong, I would also recommend \"The Greed of a Man\" (a Hong Kong drama) and \"Itaewon Class\"( a South Korea drama). The male lead achieved their lifetime goal spending long enough time like Andy. We all know they are fictions, but so what? Just learn the message.\n",

That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.\n",

      "Content: Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is \"Red,\" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made \"connections\" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is \"Andy,\" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is \"Warden Norton\" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, \"Shawshank\" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. \"Red,\" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: \"....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason....\" Most viewers will agree.\n",

      "Content: At first, before starting the movie, I thought \"Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie\". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie \"The Last Castle\" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor.\n",

This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating.

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!\n",

      "Content: I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.\n",

      "Content: When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought \"Yea, I could understand that\". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity.It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery.Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different.If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.\n",

      "Content: As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..\"I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...\"The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as \"Dumb-Ass\". Andy says....\"its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction\" Then Red says..\"Why don't we put it on Educational category?\"(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as \"Educational\" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..\"Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life\".Thanx to all.\n",

      "Content: Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was \"cool\" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The \"weaknesses\" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.\n",

      "Title: Escape from Shawshank\n",
      "Content: It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a worthy one.At the end of the day, \"Shawshank\" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration.That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film.\n",

      "Content: In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT!As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing \"Fat @$$\" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his \"Rehabilitated?\" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls \"500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,\", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS!I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10.\n",

      "Title: A Sort of Secular Redemption\n",
      "Content: The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (\"Shawshank\" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called \"The Sisters\". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the \"Sisters\" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Brubaker\" and the more recent \"The Last Castle\". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, \"The Green Mile\", based, like \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word \"prison\", from the French \"pris\" (\"taken\"), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as \"penitentiary\" or \"reformatory\" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the \"fixer\" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted \"The Godfather\" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. \"Shawshank\" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his \"rickshaw\" film was going) and \"redemption\", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word \"redemption\" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10\n",

      "Content: Ok, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10.\n",

      "Title: Triumph of the Human Spirit\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is often hailed as a cinematic masterpiece-and for good reason. Adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film weaves an extraordinary tale of hope, perseverance, and friendship, transcending the confines of its prison setting to touch the very essence of the human spirit. It is not merely a film; it is an enduring piece of art that resonates with universal themes, offering inspiration and motivation to audiences worldwide.A Journey of Redemption:\n",
      "The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. In prison, Andy befriends Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned inmate known for his ability to procure contraband. Over the course of two decades, Andy's quiet resilience, intellect, and unyielding hope transform not only his life but the lives of those around him.Performances: A Showcase of Talent\n",
      "Tim Robbins delivers a career-defining performance as Andy Dufresne, embodying quiet strength and unrelenting optimism. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of iconic; his warm, introspective narration lends the film its soul. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is electric, making their friendship the emotional core of the film.The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, adds depth to the story, creating a vivid tapestry of life within Shawshank.Themes: Hope as a Beacon\n",
      "At its heart, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope-its power to sustain, transform, and ultimately liberate. Andy's unwavering belief in a better future, symbolized by his escape and the iconic poster of Rita Hayworth, serves as a reminder that the human spirit can overcome even the darkest circumstances.The film also explores themes of friendship, justice, and institutionalization. Red's journey from a man resigned to his fate to one who dares to hope mirrors the transformative power of Andy's optimism.Technical Brilliance:\n",
      "Roger Deakins' cinematography is another highlight of the film. From the claustrophobic interiors of the prison to the breathtaking final scene on the shores of Zihuatanejo, Deakins captures both the despair and beauty of Andy's journey. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the visuals, evoking a spectrum of emotions-from sorrow to triumph.Conclusion: A Testament to Cinema's Potential\n",
      "The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film-it is an experience, a meditation on life's struggles and the power of the human spirit. It reminds us that redemption is always within reach, and that even in the bleakest circumstances, hope can shine as a guiding light.This timeless classic reaffirms the transformative power of cinema, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration, motivation, or simply the joy of witnessing a perfect piece of storytelling.\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\"\n",
      "With that simple yet profound message, The Shawshank Redemption cements its place as one of the greatest films ever made.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****\n",

The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.\n",

      "Content: This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience \"It's all about TIME and PRESSURE...\" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.\n",

      "Content: This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com\n",

This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10\n",

      "Content: I quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the greatest film in history is laughable.Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There's the \"sisters\" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The \"sisters\" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of \"history\".This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of \"character\" film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know when to shout \"cut\". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that resolve any uncertainty.Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the \"Greatest film in the world ever\" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", or Francis Ford Copolla helmed \"Megaforce\".I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that. But anyone who rates it the greatest ever should try \"Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"Casablanca\" - something, anything that's not so *worthy*.\n",

      "Content: I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.5/10\n",

Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!\n",

Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations.\n",

Yes, it can be your favorite movie but objectively I won't trust your opinion on movies that much.The movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie. Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good. But this movie average quality of Cinematography, Scores and Sound Effects. Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time. The Green Mile is directed by same person, Frank Darabont. And that movie has amazing Screenplay, Film Editing, Acting Cinematography, Makeups, Costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration. All of them are really good, just scores are average. But as I sad in this movie we don't have amazing Cinematography, Film Editing, Original Scores...\n",

      "Content: Watching this film made me think about the genre of \"prison\"-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what \"shawshank\" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in \"the hole\" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say \"starwars\" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs.

No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the \"cake\". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it.

I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since \"The Crying Game.\" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of \"The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.\n",

      "Content: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.\n",

      "Content: The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well.\n",

I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film.This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them.This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.\n",

      "Content: If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.\n",

      "Content: Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.\n",

      "Content: An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities.

      "Content: A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.\n",

      "Content: I saw (once again) last night \"Shawshank Redemption\". If I have seen it once, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time.\"Shawshank\" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current \"human\" existence. I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival.This is a movie that NO ONE should miss.\n",

      "Content: I'd never heard of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a \"sleeper,\" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Heat.\" I didn't see \"Forrest Gump\" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose \"Shawshank\" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making \"Hey, it's not all that!\" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for \"The Big Lebowski,\" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like \"Rocky Horror\" once was. I saw \"Rocky Horror\" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.\n",

      "Title: Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film\n",
      "Content: If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10\n",

      "Content: It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time.Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning.It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple \"prison drama\", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free.-10/10\n",

Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings? 2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!)

I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel (Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i think) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.\n",

There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV.

I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film.If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. You simply will never find a better film, ever.The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and lover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to life in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately befriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison itself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals. After a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the help of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the prison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob Gunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax fraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is \"friends\" with the officials.I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture, but believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him gives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up. The cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You will find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad times and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise twist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally breathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters, felt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters, loathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest certain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is. I would actually have cried at this movie, if it weren't for me being so emotionally paralyzed by the cast and story.\n",

      "Content: I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the \"original\" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon.\n",

I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big \"prison\" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with \"The Green Mile\" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's \"Oz\" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, \"Reservoir Dogs\" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\", I find myself here at \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.\n",

      "Title: When they give you life, that's what they take\n",
      "Content: Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the \"Sisters\" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis \"Red\" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****\n",

      "Content: Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why?I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that \"Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him.\" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip \"The Letter Duet\" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: \"Music makes you free!\"The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any \"corrupted decency.\" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony...\" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: \"Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!\" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?\n",

      "Content: All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really \"Red\". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.\n",

      "Content: What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a prison movie, yes, but it is so much more than that. First, let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it: Stephen King for writing this magnum opus, Frank Darabont for his stellar directing, Tim Robbins for the job he did and, of course, Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movie.This was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike. It was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and rectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You couldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You couldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the happy ending.Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It didn't get the awards it deserved, but like the Utah Jazz in the late 90's playing the Bulls, Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition. Although, it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise.\n",

      "Content: The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can't miss a movie like this....\n",

      "Title: #1 on IMDB's top 250, one of the best movies of all time and more than 6200 reviews... what's more to say about this movie?\n",
      "Content: As I said in the summary, there are too many reviews for this movie and it's among the best movies of all time. So, why I wanted to review it? Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs. This is out of my system, now I can go to the review.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it). Everything in this movie is perfect: the dialogue is clever and well written, with many great lines (included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman), the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in 1990s movies, and the performances are very strong and heartfelt. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers. Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning, but more the movie goes on more you come to like him. Freeman also narrates the movie, and here is suave, easy to empathize with and likeable (as in all his other movies). And also the supporting players in the movie are good, including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks Hatlen.My favourite scene apart the tear-jerking ending? The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers. So, you don't have to like prison dramas for liking this movie. Yes it's depressing and sad in points - but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted, and deserves all the praises that received. A movie that has to be seen at least once, and if you don't love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist!\n",

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10\n",

      "Title: It is a good film and i like it\n",
      "Content: When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption\", which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Content: I will never forget the first time I watched \"The Shawshank Redemption\", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film \"with the poster\" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone \"The Godfather\" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if \"The Shawshank Redemption\", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly.This is the strength of \"The Shawshank Redemption\", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence.And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is \"Get busy living or get busy dying\". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is \"The Shawshank Redemption\"In the same vein than \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Shawshank\" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : \"Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose.\" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.\n",

The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen.The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures the essence of hope, friendship, and resilience. The film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder, as he navigates the harsh realities of Shawshank prison. Morgan Freeman delivers an unforgettable performance as Red, the seasoned inmate who befriends Andy and narrates the story with depth and emotion.What makes this film truly exceptional is its storytelling. Frank Darabont's direction, combined with Stephen King's powerful source material, results in a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The pacing is perfect, the dialogues are thought-provoking, and the emotional payoff is immense. The cinematography and Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score add to the film's timeless appeal.Beyond being a prison drama, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about never giving up, no matter the odds. The climax is one of the most satisfying in film history, leaving the audience inspired and deeply moved. It's no surprise that this film remains at the top of IMDb's list of greatest movies ever made.\n",

      "Content: I realise now that the immense praise that Shawshank receives - being number 1 on the IMDb list, nearly universal adoration and a cemented position as an iconic classic - is all completely deserved.I had been wanting to watch The Shawshank Redemption for a couple years, and once I did it blew me away. I even wanted to watch it again today, just a day after, and relive this movie again and the joy it gave me.I've gotten used to watching very subpar, modern movies but this was a movie that deeply moved me - it tells the story of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongly jailed for a crime he didn't commit, and illustrates his life over the next 20 years, and the unforgettable characters he meets along the way. It is a movie about friendship in its purest and simplest forms.Shawshank is a gem because it makes you think - but about things what will be unique to you: about yourself, life, and what you make of its ephemerality, (or power, corruption and the justice system). It evokes visceral emotion in you: empathy, love: you will root for the main characters and feel a growing bond with them through the 2 hours and 22 minutes, almost as if you are an inmate and a friend in Shawshank yourself; it will make you laugh and make you cry.The script is genuinely beautifully written, and several times throughout I thought to myself how it often sounded like poetry. Morgan Freeman in particular delivers an amazing, sensitive performance through both his narration and acting, and the rest of the cast are equally as essential and perfect for their characters, with rich visuals and cinematography bringing the camaraderie and encapsulating the mood in Shawshank to life respectively.This movie will bring you hope, which may be a dangerous thing, but which also may be the best of things - as well as something that we all quite possibly need now, today, more than ever.Sorry for writing such a long review and thank you for reading. I love Shawshank!!\n",

      "Content: This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.\n",

Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the  white guy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and reflections.  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve.3 out of 10.   For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark.  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke.  I heartily agree with those choices.\n",

      "Content: Man, I just finished \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" and let me tell you, it hit me like a right hook from Red himself. Here's the thing: I'm 25, fresh outta a brutal breakup, and feeling lost like Andy Dufresne in that prison yard. But this movie, man, it gave me a flicker of hope, a spark to fight for my own freedom.It ain't about some grand escape, though Andy pulling that off was pretty damn sweet. It's about the tiny victories, the chipping away at the walls (metaphorical and literal) that confine you. Like Andy carvin' that chess piece outta soap, bit by bit, year after year. That's the resilience I gotta find, you know?And Red, man, that dude's got wisdom dripping off him like rain. He's seen it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and he ain't lost his hope. He tells Andy, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" That line, man, it stuck with me. It's like a lifeline, a reminder that even in the darkest depths, there's a chance to claw your way back to the light.Now, I ain't sayin' I'm gonna tunnel out of my apartment with a rock hammer, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" did something for me. It showed me that even when you're stuck, even when you're beat down, there's a way to fight back. It's about finding your own hope, your own way to crawl through the Shawshank of your own life. And maybe, just maybe, find your own redemption on the other side.That's what this movie left me with, a 25-year-old with a bruised heart, but a newfound spark in his eyes. And hey, if Andy Dufresne can make it, maybe I can too.\n",

Swallow the truth.Movie lovers, as opposed to the general movie enjoyer, have, like most disciples of art a much more developed, or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly. (You can't expect your classmates to love jazz, prog rock and classical music, just because you do.) Shawshank Redemtion is, obviously, generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment.

      "Content: Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure\n",

This was a first time watch and the movie definitely lived up to the hype and expectations.Positives for The Shawshank Redemption (1994):\n",
      "As the movie's title would suggest, this is a story about redemption for our group of characters as they are stuck in prison under the cruel leadership of the warden. This is one of the best stories I've seen in any movie in my entire life and it's no surprise why this got nominated for Best Screenplay and it should've been nominated and won Best Picture, but then again the Oscars don't know real cinema. It goes without saying that everyone in the cats does a phenomenal job with their performances. The standout performances are easily Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding. I can safely say that these two are among the greatest movie characters of all time and I love the interactions they have with each other throughout the movie. Then, you have Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton and Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley, who are among the most hated movie characters I've seen in a long time. There are a lot of times where these two punks do stuff to the prisoners that shouldn't even be happening and yet they can do it because they think they're above the law. The moment when they finally get caught for their misdeeds was so satisfying to see happen and they both got exactly what they deserved. And finally, the final scene is simply one of the best movie endings in the history of cinema.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a true testament to the art of filmmaking and has earned its spot as one of my favorite movies of all time.\n",

That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption.Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one the fainest examples.\n",

      "Title: A Story Of Hope & Resilence\n",
      "Content: Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate \"Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well.\n",

      "Content: Watching The Shawshank Redemption in 4K was an absolute treat and solidified why this movie is my all-time favourite. The upgraded resolution brought the incredible cinematography to life, making every scene even more immersive. From the gritty textures of Shawshank Prison to the breathtaking final sequences, the 4K format added a new depth that I hadn't experienced before.The story, of course, remains unmatched. Andy Dufresne's journey of hope, resilience, and ultimate freedom is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances that feel timeless, with Freeman's narration still sending chills down my spine.What struck me most in this rewatch was how brilliantly the themes of friendship and perseverance were woven into every moment. Whether it's Andy's quiet determination or Red's heartfelt reflections, the emotional weight of this film is undeniable.If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption in 4K, do yourself a favour and experience it in the highest quality possible. It's more than a film-it's a masterpiece that deserves to be cherished again and again. This rewatch reminded me why it's a cinematic classic that I'll never tire of revisiting.\n",

      "Title: If you can say overrated, I can say Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: In the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those films, which are undoubtly overrated.  However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!  I don't know about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic thunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face.  When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real \"great\" movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation.\n",

      "Title: I can see why this is rated Number 1 on IMDb.\n",
      "Content: Based on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on IMDb.A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely imprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and befriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The men's friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot puts it, \"solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.\" This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long. However, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid, blending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong, dramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama, tragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review. Therefore, you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it. It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (Forrest Gump won that year). A must-see for anybody.Grade A\n",

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption: A Masterpiece of Hope and Friendship\n",
      "Content: If there's one movie I'd recommend to anyone, it's The Shawshank Redemption. This film is the perfect example of storytelling done right. It's emotional, gripping, and leaves you thinking about it long after the credits roll. Honestly, it's a solid 10/10 in my book.The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife. What follows is a tale of resilience, friendship, and hope in the bleakest of circumstances. Morgan Freeman as Red, the narrator and Andy's closest friend in Shawshank, delivers one of the most iconic performances ever. His voice alone could carry the entire movie, but paired with his acting, it's pure gold.What really sets this film apart is its pacing and attention to detail. Every scene feels purposeful, and the way the plot unfolds keeps you hooked. The bond between Andy and Red is so well-developed that you feel their highs and lows as if they were your own. And the ending? It's one of the most satisfying conclusions ever, a perfect payoff for the journey you've just been taken on.Beyond the incredible acting and plot, the film has a deeper message about the power of hope and perseverance. It shows how even in the darkest times, the human spirit can shine through. The dialogue is unforgettable (who doesn't love the \"Get busy living or get busy dying\" line?), and the cinematography is stunning, especially considering it was made in the 90s.If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and make it your next movie night pick. It's not just a film; it's an experience.\n",

      "Content: Few films have achieved the enduring acclaim and emotional depth of *The Shawshank Redemption*.

Thomas Newman's haunting score underscores every triumph and heartbreak, elevating the storytelling to poetic levels.What sets *The Shawshank Redemption* apart is its ability to resonate universally. It speaks to the resilience of hope even in the darkest circumstances.

      "Content: Okay, let's say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz.  Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has:1.)  A corrupt warden 2.)  Brutal guards 3.)  Homosexual gang attacks (at least not in a shower) 4.)  Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery 5.)  All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases. 6.)  No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple picture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women. 7.)  A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison 8.)  Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs.  I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like us...a chilling thought. 9.)  Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape, 10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new life.I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say.  The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as \"gritty realism\" all because it is based in a prison...ho-hum.\n",

      "Content: Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.\n",

      "Content: Well, I've seen this film more times than I can count, and honestly, it hits me just as hard every single time. There's a reason this film is considered one of the greatest of all time!At its heart, it's a story about hope-hope so powerful that it can survive even in the toughest situations.Watching Andy and Red face the hardships of prison life, only to somehow hold on to their dignity and dreams, is nothing short of inspiring.The way the film uses its setting and characters is incredible. No matter how bad things get, there's always a way out if you refuse to give up.Look at Andy's fight against the system and Red's journey from hopelessness to freedom... how often do we let life's struggles hold us back without seeing the bigger picture? Sometimes, the real prison is not the wall around us -- it's the limits we put on ourselves.\n",

      "Content: In this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television, we are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for TV movies. There are so many outlets these days, that its unlikely that you'll watch any movie on TV today, and not have another opportunity to watch the same film, in its entirety within a week.Amidst this morass of celluloid, and electronic representations thereof, there are films, which never leave you. You may be absentmindedly changing the channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you come across one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the beginning, middle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you. Your mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say, unconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm feeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to come.You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a spot to sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste. You will not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people, but 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music, and our conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with  the generosity of  Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time one of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven filmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to the novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one caveat, that they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity, Frank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King story, \"TheWoman in the Room\".  And King was impressed. When years later Frank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called  'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', King was only too happy to accede.What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history. Thank you sir, thank you both.\n",

      "Content: Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say \"OMG, I love this story!\" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made.\n",

      "Content: A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's \"In the Name of the Father\" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, life's all about opinions...\n",

It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.\n",

      "Content: A fair number of the movies that rank high on this site's top 250 all time list also share a parallel 'life' as literature, so let's start there.The book \"Rita Hayworth, etc...\" is the best of the 'Different Seasons' tetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a challenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so on. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence -- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for 'more funding'.Darabont didn't have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here. We're stuck with borrowings: parts of \"Convict 99\", \"Gilda\", \"Brubaker\", \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; musically, the \"Marriage of Figaro\" aria -- it's actually not a bad bit of self-reference. It's the only good visual part here, and even that is smothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas' \"...Monte Cristo\"...The book does a good job of playing with the readers' expectations and using irony. There's no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently than this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogether.This isn't a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things, it's hard to find a truly bad movie any more -- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn't the case 20 - 30 years ago.But there's no way I can love it. It just isn't the sort of movie that resonates with *me*, because the story is just 'there' with no life of its own.\n",

      "Content: To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good.The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies.I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.\n",

      "Content: I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night. So naturally I say to my father, \"Dad, I think it's time to watch Shawshank\". I almost regret watching it. It is that good. It's like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, \"So have you seen Shawshank?\". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them about for the next 27 minutes.You probably still won't believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see. It's that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it. Now when I see a movie all I think is, I've already seen the best.Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will say is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother to finish reading this. Just go and watch it.\n",

      "Content: This Film has a Strange History. Nominated for Seven Oscars (winning none) the Movie was not a Box-Office Hit and Faded pretty much into Obscurity as an Arty Film with two Lead Actors Delivering Standard Good Work, but Nothing to get Excited about.But Something Happened that is Really Unexplainable. People got Excited about it. No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement, it just Happened. A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved Movies Ever. Managing to Steadily Climb to \"God-Like\" Status among Best of Lists and Fanatic Praise.It is a Fine Movie. A Throwback Movie. A more or less Standard Storytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous Misfortune. A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good. Nothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go. But what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the Long Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly.This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. it's just a Smooth, Entertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the Job Done.\n",

      "Content: simply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?\n",

      "Content: The story is described by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander.In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time.Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.\n",

      "Content: Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, \"Shawshank\" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****\n",

Afer all, acting was great, I have no bad things say about that, it's only a bad script, for my opinion. Nowadays, when there's such realistic prison descriptions, as OZ and Prison break, this one doesn't give the spark. For a good prison movie I reckon the following: If you wanna see a good prison movie, you should watch ' Blood In Blood Out ', If you haven't had a chance already. Now, there's a reality check and a great movie, which haven't lost it's best-before date, like this one has.\n",

Everyone involved must have perfect \"form\". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, \"This is just right!\" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again.\n",

As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.\n",

There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather.

The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.\n",

The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his much-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's once-pseudonym, \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to build or define characters, background, or story progression. It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a man's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even deserve royalties.\n",

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul.

You want examples, I got examples! \"Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright\" or \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\" or \"Terrible thing, to live in fear\" or \"It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away\" or \"need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone\" or \"Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die\" - if you say so, sensei!Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story.\n",

      "Title: Not That Great\n",
      "Content: This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you. Popularity is a reflection of the current state of society's desires, nothing more.\n",

      "Content: Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.\n",

The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have watched \"Shawshank\" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is, \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie you have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys DVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box of tissues nearby.\n",

      "Content: I enjoyed this the first time I saw it. But then again I was only an easily impressionable 14-year-old, craving for new emotion. Recently, more than 10 years later, I revisited it, and barely managed to finish it. Bluntly, it's as plain and trite as it gets. In fact, I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a simple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....We have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim's character). It's told through the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan's character). The narrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and flow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration - extreme simplicity. It's stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it around and \"apply\" it diligently. The others only observe the snowball effect.I hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them. I hope...1/5 - Skip this, if you are over 15. There is no art here - almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is one of the best films of 1994. It is one of the better films of the 90's. It most certainly is not one of the best films of all time, and in turn, obviously not the best of all time. I respect those of you who have put it at number one. At least it's better than calling Happy Gilmore number one, but I digress.This is addressed to anyone who wonders how in all the world this film beat The Godfather, Citizen Kane, 2001, and even Pulp Fiction for best film of all time. Each of these films is celebrated, henceforth it is also \"chic\" to bad-mouth these movies. People hear that Citizen Kane is great so often that when someone sees it and is disappointed, they take it personally. Same with Pulp Fiction, so many loved it, that when somebody didn't like it all that much, their dislike becomes hate, relative to the passion some people have for the film.Another prime example is Titanic. Where is it? It's not here on the Top 250. Yet upon its release (and the subsequent months it was out) you almost didn't hear a single negative word about it. Not until the people who were so sick of the raves went, minds already made up to hate it. Some people are so pretentious that they despise anything mainstream. Hence, the backlash against Titanic.Now on to The Shawshank Redemption. The Shawshank Redemption is a film, like Titanic, that I have never heard one uncynical person say a bad thing about. Obviously then, its ratings will be high (well-deserved). However, also working in Shawshank's favor is the fact that it has never gone mainstream. The fact that it tanked at the box office may have been the best thing that happened to it. It never has become cool to knock Shawshank, therefore we rarely have people rating it 1 out of spite. With this lack of poor reviews, it is no wonder Shawshank shot to the top. It is a marvelous little movie, but certainly no Citizen Kane or 2001.\n",

      "Content: Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and \"nasty-nice\" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term \"perfect piece of entertainment\" does not exaggerate.\n",

      "Content: I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message \"Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives.\" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me. My rating 4/10.\n",

      "Title: A beautifully crafted tale that underlines subjects that have been forgotten in modern films- friendship,hope, freedom\n",
      "Content: This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.\n",

I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.\n",

      "Content: That this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for how folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how else could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from. And then come back and tell me this is anything other than a hotch potch, a 50s throwback with a 90s sentiment.\n",

      "Content: I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.\n",

      "Content: While the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor matched with each other as well as they could be (see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless ensemble acting in films).The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters from several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable melodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of hope.While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all.  It's strongest moments are borrowed from prison films as far back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart (in his second role).   While Shawshank is superior overall than some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films have not already been before.  While at times it borders on being brutal, it still is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility.  Were it to more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like it would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally exhausting--which this film is not.I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many.  I suppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point (1962), Riot in Cellblock 11, Short Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are prisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior films.\n",

      "Content: I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.I hope...\n",

I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie. This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. That's the power of this movie. I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others. Story goes this way:A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. He got two life sentences back to back. He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank.Please rent the DVD and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.\n",

      "Content: When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is an example of magical film-making at its best. When I say best, I really mean it. There are a lot of great films out there, and a lot that make me glad I saw them. But Shawshank is, above all of them, at the top of the list.I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to watch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched the whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing I could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The film has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it is shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must watch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next, pristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a filmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging what I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that awareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and again. It never stops being great.As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont as well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and magnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes that I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the performances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr. Robbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to make sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever made.\n",

      "Content: My favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see.\n",

      "Content: I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.\n",

      "Title: Why film beats books\n",
      "Content: The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (\"Dumass's\") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering.\n",

Then there's the hidden mystery of the escape that's going on, and you know it's going on, but you never see it hinted at until the moment it's revealed. This will keep you engaged.The selection of relatively unknown actors aside from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, playing minor but pivotal roles magnificently adds to the genuine feel of the story and the feeling of being there in the moment.No surprise that this is often regarded the greatest movie of all time.\n",

      "Content: Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just personal preference.All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the time to watch it.\n",

You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie was an ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it.\n",

It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars.

Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don't tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it's an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances. The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are it's equal. All and all, The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie.\n",

Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison.

I love every single thing about this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I'm talking about because it's the only movie that I've seen so many times and it never failed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King's novella, great direction by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive dialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others, but there's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen thousands of them. Remember \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies\".\n",

      "Content: What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called \"one of the best movies of all time\", \"a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom\" and a \"latter-day retelling of the Gospel story\". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called \"life is unfair\".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed.\n",

The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.So see it, buy it, love it.\n",

      "Content: The great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances. This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran convict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy DuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the most part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude compassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's \"Red\" noticed right away that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to their bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have been reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a memorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film was Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by society, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will for their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given sufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the foundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which exploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The narration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for the kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a man doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration to do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very structure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and \"Red\" each managed to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great cathartic experience of the film.\n",

I have seen it over 100 times since I first 'experienced' it, and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine.

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made.  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless.  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned.  A true classic!\n",

Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the acting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see two Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story: Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I think about this friendship between the two men... The sentence \"Get busy livin or get busy dyin\", well in a way it shaped my whole live. This is definitely the best film I have ever seen\n",

      "Content: This film (or may be masterpiece) changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first time.We learn from books, we learn from our parents, we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like \"The Shawshank Redemption\".Once upon a time, I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. Then some suggested me to watch this. What happened next was simply miracle. The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine. But it was hope that kept him alive. That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time. The dialogues are simply straight yet touching.The movie has universal appeal - It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heart.Double thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema.This movie was not made for Oscars (although it grabbed multiple nominations) and not for critics (some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb 250). It was made for common people like us.Humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.\n",

      "Title: How would you define \"human\"?\n",
      "Content: You'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time (early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think he did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow inmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life sentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other, learn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words, \"intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption\" would all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It's just one you'll have to watch if you love movies.\n",

      "Content: one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.\n",

The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.\n",

      "Content: Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal.Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+\n",

Villains with motivation. Heroes are not idiots. Events are justified by circumstances that push the heroes to independent actions. But my God, there are so many films that are so many times more worth your time and emotional energy that Shawshank Redemption is a quiet and meditative movie that is hard to watch at times. It's impossible for me personally to worry about characters that look so fake and created specifically for this story. They cannot be imagined in other circumstances, outside the picture. The lack of deep meanings and the possibility of different interpretations of the characters and what is happening is annoying.

      "Content: My story is one of fate. I went to the video store expecting to get Terminator II on laserdisc. It was out, and out of desperation to rent something, I asked for what was new. I was given the \"Shawshank Redemption\". I had never heard of it, quite honestly, but I gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of \"time pass\".The first time through watching it, I thought it was good. Nothing extraordinary. But something made me watch it again. And I was hooked. I can't explain it, but this movie gets better every time you watch it. I ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan.Watch this movie, as your bucket list of things to do in life. You really have not lived till you have seen it.I admit to being completely obsessed by the movie, owning it on every medium imaginable, and having all the books and posters about it. But do not let my obsession dissuade you. I do not impress easily, but I can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema.Every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in American cinema.\n",

The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10\n",

The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.\n",

      "Title: A great film of a helping hand leading to end-around justice\n",
      "Content: It shouldn't be lost on anyone that well into the 21st century, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has been the No. 1 film, or close to the top for years among movie viewers who have rated movies on IMDb. With more than 2.4 million ratings just on this film alone, it's probably safe to say that it would stay close to its top spot in any public survey.What a great film the Shawshank Redemption is. Even though thousands have written reviews already, a little should yet be said about great films that don't win the awards or become big box office hits, but become highly popular mostly for their story. That usually is a matter of justice, within the story itself, and for the film having been made. And, justice is the undergirding theme of this film.For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the conclusion is a real surprise. And it brings to closure all of the angst and apprehension and concern one has about the wrong treatment of the hero, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins. The narrative format adds to a sense of the drama and reality of a story as told by Red Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. One wants so badly to see an innocent man exonerated of the crime for which he was convicted. While the circumstances of the plot make that impossible, the alternative ending serves justice to the hilt. Because, in this way, justice is served on those who abused their power. The warden and guard commander couldn't be convicted for that, but in their evil ways they were open to other law violations for which they could be taken downSo, the ending satisfies justice and the hearts of so many viewers. It is reminiscent of a true story of a true gangster. The big-time gangster of the prohibition era, Al Capone, could never be caught and prosecuted for so many crimes he committed, including murder. But the federal government was finally able to convict him for income tax evasion which led to his imprisonment.Here's a film that didn't even cover its costs at the box office when first released, and took a re-release to earn a modest sum. Yet it remains a favorite, far above many films that have won multiple academy awards over the years. While the cast all are very good, and the production qualities first rate, it's the story - the plot with a superb screenplay that makes this a great film.While this movie was based on a 1982 story by Stephen King, a big piece of the plot was not an original idea. Either Stephen King and/or Director Frank Darabont, may have gotten the idea from an earlier movie, for prisoner Andy Dufresne helping the warden and guards with their taxes and money laundering schemes, and then the law catching up with the crooked prison officials at the end. Both of these situations were first part of a 1968 movie, \"Hot Millions,\" although they were just a small aside in the plot of that caper comedy. That film starred Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. In it, Ustinov plays Marcus Pendleton, who was serving time in a British prison for embezzlement. Just before leaving prison, Marcus finishes the prison governor's income tax report - saving him about 500 pounds sterling for the year. Later he sees a headline in a newspaper stand that a prison governor was arrested for tax fraud.\n",

I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey! it ain't number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again.so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You...\n",

      "Content: Wow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40 times... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why:First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them as Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world.\n",

      "Content: I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was stolen, this certainly was too.There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape from Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the \"highly intelligent\" star, and the concentration on the \"hole\", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub\n",

Of course, like any movie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic triumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture.

      "Content: Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.\n",

      " one of the greatest crimes at the Oscars in History\n",
      "Content: I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: \"Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.\"Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages.\n",

      "Content: I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time.\n",

      "Content: What can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more.Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spirit.In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the mental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character, full of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to \"teach them a lesson\".Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved.\n",

      "Content: **Cons:** The movie's pacing is slow-though it fits the tone and plot. That said, it's not quite deserving of the top spot in the \"greatest films of all time\" rankings. *The Godfather* has earned that title hands down.It's also a missed opportunity not seeing Red with the harmonica. That would've added something extra. As for the \"Brooks\" storyline, it drags on unnecessarily; a few minutes would've sufficed.**Pros:** On the plus side, the film exceeds expectations, especially with its plot twists. Every scene sets up one thing, then delivers something entirely different-keeping you engaged.The ending? It's one of the few that actually sticks the landing. *The Shawshank Redemption* nails it.The final act really takes the intensity up a notch, making it an exciting finish.Final verdict: an 8 out of 10. Not quite a 9.3, but it's still a solid pick.\n",

This film definitely beat out \"Million Dollar Baby\" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when \"Shawshank\" deserved its due.

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are memorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies come with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess it up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow of the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a sense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because if everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed. Well, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the acting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories come in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history.\n",

      "Content: From the outside, the Shawshank State Prison looks like an English country home, with turreted corners and a wide open surrounding lawn.   It's only when you get inside and see the walls and meet the brutal guards that you start to realize that the state government simply wants you out of sight and out of mind.  And that if you die in Shawshank, the only reason that might interest the government or the public is that it will save them money.The two main protagonists are Andy Durfresne (played by Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman).  Andy is the new prisoner, a banker and investment expert convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  Red is the experienced con, who makes do on the inside by smuggling cigarettes, whiskey, tooth brushes, movie posters, etc. into the prison, and facilitating a market between the prisoners and between the prisoners and the guards.Two other important characters are prison Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and the Captain Hadley (wonderfully played by Clancy Brown). Andy, obviously, isn't your usual prisoner.  For one thing, he doesn't look very tough, certainly not tough enough to have killed anyone. Red bets that Andy will be the first of the new draft of prisoners to \"break\" during their first night locked in cells, by crying.  And \"The Sisters,\" prisoners who delight in raping other prisoners, target Andy from day one.Well, both Red and \"The Sisters\" are wrong. Andy doesn't say a bad word about his confinement or his cell.  And \"The Sisters\" have to beat the Hell out of Andy time after time to get any enjoyment out of him.  (Another feature of prison life which Andy doesn't complain about.)  What Andy does, is try to get on living. He has this hobby of rock carving, for which Red can supply the necessary tools and rocks.  He is also good at doing things like filling out tax forms and giving investment advice. This skill comes to the attention of the Warden and the guards, especially Hadley.  Soon, although not soon enough, Andy is given a trivial job in the prison library and protection from The Sisters in turn for providing investment advice to the guards and, for laundering all the money the Warden is making off the free labor he controls.Andy does other things to.  Over time he manages to turn the dark,  basement library at the prison into a real library where other convicts can simply read or, with ambition, try for their high school credentials.  In other words, Andy, although a convicted murder is good for the people around him, even a bunch of convicts doing hard time.Is this the way prisons really operate? Can one person make the difference? Well, probably not. In fact I suspect Shawshank is shown to be a nicer place to live than any real state prison is, but the level of gross brutality displayed in the movie by both the guards and by some of the prisoners was all I wanted to see and enough to convince me that I wouldn't want to live there. Also, this is a movie about redemption, a rare enough event in ordinary life to motivate some \"suspension of disbelief.\"There's the other side of redemption too, which is punishment of the truly guilty.  The Shawshank Redemption supplies both. And has fun doing so. In fact, when I saw most of the movie by accident on TV, I - who never watches TV - found myself yelling at the kids to be quite so I could follow everything that went on.  And then I went out the next day and rented the video both to enjoy watching it again, and to help answer some left over questions, like \"who really did get redemption?\"I strongly encourage you to see the movie to find out the answer to that, and several other questions.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected.\n",

      "Content: I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.\n",

      "Title: Not Just Another Prison Film......\n",
      "Content: I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said \"That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film.'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century. Movies like this really change lives.10/10\n",

      "Content: I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy's. His fears, his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer, Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his perseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life outside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It's only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it, it's just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little \"pick-me-up\".\n",

      "Content: This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have such great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture. This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own apart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are deservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no matter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank Darabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green Mile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also very disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film, because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.\n",

      "Title: I just love this movie\n",
      "Content: The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org\n",

      "Content: I know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box office then became a hit through video rental. I am probably not going to add anything new. I am a Stephen King fan, and have a policy not to watch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be quite dodgy. However, I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was not disappointed. This film is about hope and redemption and the characterisations are faithful to the original story.Tim Robbins is perfect in the lead role, quietly enigmatic, just as I had pictured when reading the book.The movie is quite old fashioned in concept but don't let this deter you. You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end up feeling better because of watching it. The relationship between the two lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human nature.You must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before, because it makes you feel good.This film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes of \"it's a wonderful life\" and \"the wizard of oz\".I can't think of a single criticism.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.\n",

      "Content: This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella titled \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\". This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The lessons you learn, the emotions that were touched, the friendships that were made and overall, the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special. This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that it's all you ever know. It shows the darkness about being in prison. In conclusion, this movie is a 10/10. Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and I'll definitely rewatch it in the future.\n",

A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties.In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky', he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it.Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes.I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends.It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail.I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it already and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie...AND i expect some of my friends also did it.This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans.I hope that answers some of your doubts......This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living.\n",

The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue.

      "Content: I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before. Films have every right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic collapses. Or did for me anyway.Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship.\n",

To be taken on a the most wonderful of cinematic journeys......This is what we all dream of.Frank Darabont, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Stephen King's Finest Hour.Exceptional 10/10\n",

      "Title: The Greatest Movie Ever Made?\n",
      "Content: Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb \"greatest movie\" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the \"greatest film of all time\" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.\n",

      "Content: I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\n",

      "Title: No Redemption from Shawshank\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted, and filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a real plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing is redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are implausible.No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting. Their function is to represent \"the establishment\" and \"authority.\" The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the main character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted, he's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his imprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the warden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing so--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists, who are called \"not human\" so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of redemption.Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters. Unfortunately, serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does.\n",

      "Title: The Most Magnificent Movie Ever\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The Oscar's biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie, but it just can't compare to Shawshank. Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an Oscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story's beauty, and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking \"I heard this is good\" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more than gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to watch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many movies it's almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but think \"It can't beat Shawshank.\" Some people say that this movie is overrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie makes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they didn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. I believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it should be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is, by the very definition of the word magnificent.\n",

I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards (the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to be one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again.\n",

But when i saw it, i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlier.The movie has a beautiful plot set over 20 years. Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending. And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending. Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind. This movie is not a thriller, nor is it adventure; but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny. Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward. I have only one message for IMDb viewers. Just watch Shawshank Redemption. Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today. Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago. Well.. sometimes, cinema is like this. You go for titles, stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed. But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script, a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.\n",

      "Content: Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It's really not all that.  It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all.  That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies?  Gag me.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up?  Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? Freeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to prison come up with.  By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I've already heard.  Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come up in movies.  Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison?  That is classic jail movie material.  Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil.  How irritating",
      " If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here.  Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment.  The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right?  The `Brooks was here' hanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite.  Who hangs themselves?  My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect.  Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course.   Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs.   Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging?  You know who, a character in a movie.  That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.\n",

      "Content: In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second –or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse performances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate salvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events, shenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank, the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions.\n",

      "Content: I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" appears in 1994, I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont's best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world. No one is perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still, it's a modification, a copy thereof what was before. I think until the year 2000 most of the valuable things in film art was told. It's a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like \"The Shawshank Redemption\". In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didn't say the last words.\n",

      "Title: HOPE IS THE BEST THING!\n",
      "Content: Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡° hope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning. Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie shows a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡° Hope¡± is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever does.¡± After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you with.I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope. No matter what circumstances you live in, don¡¯t forget that hope is the best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle, to forward, and to live better in the world.\n",

      "Title: This is a fairy tale....\n",
      "Content: In fairy tales characters are straightforward good or evil, so that the audience does not get confused. Shawshank is the sort of prison where convicts are \"good\" and guards are \"evil\", so that you know immediately who to root for.The main characters in the movie are Andy and Red, respectively played by Robbins and Freeman. Robbins is an actor with a natural creepiness that cannot be neutralized even by the most positive role. We are supposed to root for Andy, but the ambiguity about his guilt is kept going two thirds into the movie and does not help to establish him as a sympathetic character. Freeman is by now a stand-in for God. He conveys gravitas and righteousness, even to a murderer. He deserves a happy ending against all odds.The story unfolds extremely slowly, with the usual bonding and strife among inmates and abusive guards stirring the mix. The only plot twist is an absurd conversation between Andy and the prison's warden. In possession of vital information about his case, allegedly clever Andy chooses to share it with the evil warden, rather than with his lawyer. This is clearly an idiotic decision, but so far looks like nobody noticed.However, the simple tale of a man convicted for a double murder, taking place almost exclusively within the prison walls is hardly material for a masterpiece. Even more so when based on a Stephen King novel. King may be massively famous, but subtle he is not.I guess the reasons for the huge popularity of this movie lies exactly in its simple structure and exploitation of basic emotions and human qualities such as endurance, hope, faith and integrity.The main message of a film is an even more basic \"Everything is going to be alright\". That is, if you consider decades spent in prison as a metaphor for life.\n",

      "Title: Review - The Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and there's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it truly touches the heart and soul.I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience.\n",

Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresne's epic prison sentence.Robbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red, whose non-sexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie cliches.It can be hokey, too long by 30 minutes, and perhaps even a bit preachy.

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is one of those timeless classics that pulls you in with its heartfelt storytelling and remarkable performances. At its core, it's a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit, set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank prison. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King's novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative.One of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks' storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It's a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red's own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story's broader themes of freedom and redemption.The direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage. With its pitch-perfect pacing, poetic dialogue, and an uplifting finale, The Shawshank Redemption remains a film that resonates on every rewatch. It's not just a movie; it's an experience.\n",

They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some.

It's not my favorite film ever but it's a very very good one that I'll suggest everyone who didn't see it to go and watch it. This movie is great in every aspect: performances, direction, plot, settings... But what makes it so great is that it provokes a lot of emotions in the viewers that stay with them for a while after the viewing. There are a lot of powerful moments and scenes and they are all well built in order to have more impact. And furthermore the movie is also able to stimolate a reflexion about various topics about prisons system, justice and human nature in general. In conclusion The Shawshank Redemption is clearly a must-watch, don't lose this masterpiece.\n",

      "Title: A Breathtaking Story and an Outstanding Cast,\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal movie with a very well developed storyline, outstanding character development and a fantastic cast. It's almost immediately engaging, I found myself engrossed by the story from the very first scene, as we follow Andy Dufresne in his journey in to prison, we feel the characters emotions, even without them being properly exposed and as the film progresses we see him form relationships in Shawshank prison that add a lot of depth. The character development in this movie is ridiculously well written and is what writers should look towards as inspiration, the relationship between Andy and Red, Brooks' entire story arch, the Warden and Captain's partnership, it's all very believable, as well as captivating thanks to a terrific script by Frank Darabont. The performances are all absolutely outstanding, Tim Robbins emotional, enclosed personality as Andy is terrific, Bob Gunton's sinister delivery, Clancy Brown's threatening persona, James Whitmore's innocent, uneducated attitude, it all comes together to create engaging, realistic people. However, the undeniable star of the show, and the main reason this film is #1 on IMDb's Top 250 has to be Morgan Freeman, his portrayal of Red is immediately enticing, he's a pure, honest man who keeps the story moving with narration, Freeman's voice-over work for this film adds that extra layer that was very necessary and added so much more power, his dialogue with Robbins is some of the best acting I have ever seen, and the moment in which he speaks about his parole for the final time is possibly the highlight of this amazing actors entire career. Very engaging, emotional, The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, but I never found myself wanting it to end, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is convicted for killing his wife and her secret lover. He is miserable in Shawshank prison, but soon makes friends in the wise Red.Best Performance: Morgan Freeman\n",

Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.\n",

      "Title: An \"O.K.\" Movie, Worshiped Because of It's Accessibility.\n",
      "Content: Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by \"Shawshank.\"The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well.\n",

      "Content: I was amazed, encaptured and enthralled when I saw this film for the first time. I was flicking idly through the television one night when I caught the opening titles just as I was about to go to bed, and thought I'd give it a try. What can I say? 3 hours later I was almost in tears over the ending, but I'll say no more.It's obvious the film has overwhelming themes of hope, friendship, redemption ad freedom, but it is the hope that so suffuses the film and lifts it above other \"triumphing over adversity\" films. It is a film that does not try to justify any governmental or judicial system, or the skill of a lawyer, but simply the hope and compassion that is part of the tarnished human spirit.I bought this film on DVD recently, replacing my rather elderly tape, and it cost me the grand total of £3 (about $5 or so) and, pound for pound, it's the best value for money I've ever spent on anything. If only all DVD's were this good and this cheap.\n",

      "Content: It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might have been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first place. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption.\n",

Maybe it's just me, but I don't think I even have any cons for this this one. No bad acting, no weird camera shots, no mistakes (as far as i know) but maybe I will watch it again and re-edit my review accordingly. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe it really IS flawless?

      "Title: A well-intentioned but unexceptional movie\n",
      "Content: I came expecting a masterpiece and left with the impression I'd seen a relatively unremarkable film with pretensions of profundity. Put plainly, the primary message is \"Hope sustains the human spirit in a world of hardship and despair,\" which is a truism that would fit nicely in a fortune cookie. Nonetheless, the power of hope can serve as an affecting theme. Perhaps this common theme is taken by so many as great depth because so much of Hollywood's product these days is appallingly shallow or callously brutal. Apparently, the public is desperate for something to care about.The direction is somewhat mannered and reminiscent of older films, which in itself is neither good nor bad. But in this case it blends with a storyline that seems virtually comprised of movie cliches of prison life. The characters are also stereotypes: the evil warden (bible-toting, naturally!), the brutal and inhuman prison guard, the gang of prison buddies, the gang of cell block victimizers, the experienced convict who has mastered the system (played by Morgan Freeman), the enigmatic newcomer who works subtly to subvert the system (played by Tim Robbins) -- all the classics on parade, with few of the unnecessary peculiarities that define real human beings! We've seen them all before, and in more realistic guise. These one-dimensional characters function with the monomania of gears in a machine, churning out a largely predictable plot. This is typical of allegorical stories, and I suspect this story can be read as allegory (which is not surprising, since it is based on a Stephen King tale). Regardless, I can honestly say not one element of the plot caught me by surprise.In all, the film seems to hover in tone and content somewhere between reality and the idealized world of the fable (say, a fable like The Green Mile, a movie by the same director). Many of the story elements seemed in one way or another contrived, which left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied and manipulated. Even good devices -- such as the well-known tendency of prisoners to become programmed by prison life, resulting in problems when they return to society (a syndrome referred to in the film as becoming \"institutionalized\") -- lose some of their power through a rather heavy-handed treatment. However, the climax of the story (although predictable) was very well-constructed and quite effective.Regarding the acting, Tim Robbins is fair, but hardly awe-inspiring. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, is a rare talent who is almost certain to turn in a superb performance. This movie is no exception, and I believe if viewers think about it, they will realize that the strongest, most eloquent and moving portion of the movie is the last half hour in which his character, Red, is the focus of attention. The extended denouement almost saved the film for me, but for this viewer the movie reached its end with only a hint of the title's promised redemption.For those of you who want to see a prison movie that is deeper, more profound, has better dialogue, plotting, and symbolism; and presents characters in now familiar roles (your assignment, compare and contrast!) but with considerably more substance and reality, check out Cool Hand Luke. It may not spell out what it's all supposed to mean in Shawshank's user-friendly, large-print narration, but it is nonetheless in all respects the superior movie.\n",

      "Content: Some animals are not meant to be caged!**The Shawshank Redemption** is a timeless masterpiece that delves deep into the human spirit, exploring themes of hope, friendship, and the relentless pursuit of freedom. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption*, the film is a poignant tale of resilience that continues to resonate with audiences worldwide.The story follows Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and his journey through the bleak and oppressive confines of Shawshank Prison. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red, the seasoned inmate who befriends Andy, is equally captivating, with his rich narration adding emotional depth to the narrative.One of the film's standout quotes, \"Some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright,\" encapsulates the essence of Andy's indomitable spirit. Despite the harsh realities of prison life, Andy's quiet defiance and unwavering hope inspire those around him. The friendship between Andy and Red is heartwarming, grounded in mutual respect and an understanding of the human condition.The cinematography is stunning, contrasting the drab monotony of the prison with moments of beauty and transcendence, such as Andy playing music over the loudspeakers or the iconic rain-soaked scene of his escape. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score further elevates these moments, making them unforgettable.The film's ending is both satisfying and uplifting, offering a profound commentary on the transformative power of hope and the enduring strength of the human spirit. Andy's escape and Red's eventual redemption are a testament to the idea that even in the darkest places, the light of hope can shine through.**The Shawshank Redemption** is not just a movie; it's an experience-a powerful reminder of the resilience within us all. It's no wonder it remains one of the highest-rated films of all time, a true cinematic gem that continues to inspire and move audiences decades after its release.\n",

This movie gives meaning to life by being a legitimate feel-good movie. \"HOPE IS A GOOD THING, MAYBE THE BEST OF THINGS, AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIES.\" the best dialogue ever written in any film ever produced. I was so into the film even I felt his redemption, I had a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Overall: The Best, The most satisfying, A pure feel-good film.\n",

They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.\n",

      "Content: This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this.\n",

      "Content: Today is the second time I've seen this movie.When I first saw it, I was fifteen years old, so I didn't see much meaning in the movie. I just admire Andy! And then there's no more.Today I read a lot of scripture, and it's a lot of knowledge. Andy's spirit is awe-inspiring, and even if you're in prison, even if you're sentenced to life in prison, you can't lose hope in lifeI think it has more or less to do with Andy's background. He was once a banker, illustrating a well-educated, three-pronged view. Ideas are important, and it is the power of hope for life, and the power of dreams that has allowed Andy to carve out a channel of redemption on the wall for twenty yearsAnd with his financial knowledge, he was able to escape to Mexico with the money he received when he was caught in the eye of the prison warden. The evidence was given to the newspapers, and the police brought the warden and the guard in a pot to put an end to the trouble. You can see the importance of knowledge.Andy and Reid's conversation is too classic. When Andy says he wants to open a hotel on the Pacific coast of Mexico, he dreams of living his life. You can say Red is a fool, how is that possible? A man sentenced to life in prison is daydreaming!That's the gap, the gap in thinking, the gap in value.It is not terrible to be trapped by high walls, for some people cannot be trapped. Birds of a feather always belong to the sky and cannot be locked up. But if the mind is trapped in a high wall, people will fall into it.\n",

I'm not sure why it wasn't a hit a first because, like virtually everybody else who has watched it, I loved everything about this film and would also consider it to be one of the best films ever made.I can't add much more to the 4,116 reviews that have already been written, but what I will say is that I've never felt so emotionally involved in a film before as I did with this one. I'd heard great things about the 'Shawshank' and that can often lead to disappointment, but in this case my expectations were far exceeded. I have to mention the ending as well, which is just poetic - in my opinion the greatest ending to a film ever.An average rating of 9.3 on IMDb from over 1.6 million votes is truly remarkable, but thoroughly deserved. I can't speak highly enough of 'The Shawshank Redemption', an amazing film that is sure to leave you feeling emotionally overwhelmed.\n",

      "Content: There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made.\n",

      "Content: I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this unforgettable movie. When you need hope, or the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just withered away on the shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2-hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally-enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must-see, must-own title.\n",

      "Content: Stephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\". The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer \"Red\", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as \"Brooks\", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the best movies ever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before, even though of it's slow 142 minute run-time. \"The Shawshank Redemption\", in my review, \"a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at its finest\".\n",

      "Content: One of the most recommended masterpieces. Highly recommended for someone who loves cinema. The Shawshank Redemption is not just a movie but a profound experience. Its timeless themes, stellar performances, and impeccable storytelling have earned it a rightful place among the greatest films ever made. Whether you watch it for the first time or revisit it, this cinematic gem is sure to leave an indelible mark on your soul. At its heart, The Shawshank Redemption is a film about hope-a rare commodity in the harsh reality of Shawshank Prison, yet one that Andy clings to relentlessly. The final scenes are a testament to the indomitable human spirit, leaving viewers with a sense of fulfillment and optimism that lingers long after the credits roll.\n",

A drama yet so natural with exceptional acting moments. Just some prisoners talking to each other. Yet it is in the list of all time best.

      "Content: Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still don't have a clue what the fuss is all about. There's hardly anything special about the movie, let alone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is somewhat promising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The performances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from demanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched the ingenious \"The Straight Story\" I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above average is as good as it gets. Both \"Midnight Express\" and \"Escape From Alcatraz\" beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10.\n",

      "Content: An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top \"prison\" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.\n",

      "Title: Upbeat prison drama\n",
      "Content: Film Review: The Shawshank Redemption (from a novel by Stephen King) The tale of the banker (Tim Robbins), who, given life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover, adapts to prison life using his native wit, as told through the eyes of another lifer (Morgan Freeman). Absorbing plot, interesting relationship between the two leads. The prison system (of Maine) exposed as brutal and corrupt, the chief guard (sadist) and the warden (sanctimonious bible basher) are particularly nasty. Setting the story between the 40s and 60s makes it a little easier to believe. Fairytale ending.Conservatives might argue all the brutality is justified in making prison a deterrent, but that hardly excuses the murders by guards and embezzlement by the warden. Of course the same people will contend insider trading keeps the stock market efficient  laws are OK as long as they do not inconvenience entrepreneurs. What we see here is a criminal injustice system similar to that which prevailed in parts of Australia at the time (and probably still does). The public doesn't care and the politicians don't want to appear soft on crime, after all, only bad people go to prison. Actually, King accepts that some prisoners have done pretty awful things, and go on doing them in prison.So who is being redeemed? The problem is that Tim Robbin's character is a moral and upright character who should not be in jail  he has no need to forgive himself. Most of the other prisoners seem to think they are innocent, which makes \"redemption\" hard for them. Perhaps Morgan Freeman's character eventually does, but at enormous cost. Anyway, it's a good yarn, and virtue (of a sort) does triumph, which is always cheering.\n",

The story of Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly imprisoned, is a powerful exploration of hope, friendship, and the human spirit. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances, and the connection between their characters feels so real and heartfelt.The pacing, the dialogue, and the emotional depth of the film are masterfully done. Every scene feels meaningful, and the ending is one of the most satisfying I've ever seen in a movie. It's not just a prison story-it's a story about life, perseverance, and the belief that even in the darkest places, hope can thrive.This is truly one of my favorite films of all time, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves deeply impactful storytelling. A timeless masterpiece!\n",

      "Title: Uplifting and sincere\n",
      "Content: The key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by Andy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope.  \"Hope is a dangerous thing,\" says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through, why he can say this and believe it.  And because this is such a well-crafted film, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by this time we have come to know them both so well. The movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank Prison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has been there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits for the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the laundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates.  Andy was a wealthy banker on the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in a nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to culpability.  The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what actually happened.  In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but there is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film's title suggests, this is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two different men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what follows beyond it. What amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of the tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made it plausible, even meaningful.  It is worth seeing just as a statement about how the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to us.\n",

      "Title: I'll compare it to a poem\n",
      "Content: Originally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption, but i've decided not to post it.  Instead i'd just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade.  i'm not going to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right now, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams. In other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together, hoping people would like it.  My plan succeeded, the teacher thought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the school newspaper. Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the same thing.  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story.  I admit that I got caught up in the ending.  But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure Hollywood.  Cliche here and there.  I recognize this for what it is:  a director's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to a large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds.  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success.  Now, with The Majestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films.  Finally!  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top 250 list.\n",

This film can not be replicated, because the film is special; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).

      "Content: Excellent movie I liked it a lot. Recommended to see it.In 1947 Andy Dufresne, vice president of a major bank in Portland (Maine), is tried for the murder of his wife and a man with whom she was having an affair. Although he insists he is innocent, the evidence is reason enough for the judge to sentence him to serve two life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Upon entering he realizes how harsh the environment is, the guards spare no effort in disciplining the inmates with the cruelest methods, especially the boss, Byron Hadley. This regime of terror has the approval of the prison warden, Samuel Norton.During the first few months, Dufresne befriends the prison's smuggling kingpin, Red, and orders a hammer for hewing stones from him. He spends his time and his forces fending off constant harassment from a gang of rapists known as \"the Sisters,\" led by Bogs Diamond. Two years later, he is selected along with Red to repair the roof of one of the prison buildings, and while doing his job, he overhears Hadley complain about a tax mess caused by an inheritance received from her brother. Of the. He offers to help him and in this way he begins to gain the trust of the staff, including the warden. This fact frees him from the pressure of \"the sisters\", since Bogs is disabled after receiving a beating from the captain. Eventually, Dufresne is transferred to the jail library to help Brooks Hatlen, until he is paroled. However, Brooks commits suicide some time later due to the depression caused by the idea of having wasted his life.\n",

      "Content: I Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that \"salvation lies within.\" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His \"rehabilitated\" speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before — as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves \"movie connoisseurs\". There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, \"I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams",
      " I hope.\" And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again, that's only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies\"\n",

Since I am for more intelligent and unpredictable type films, I am not one for movies like this.And if I would explain the movie in one sentence, I would say it is a classic cinema soap opera, perfectly crafted to emotionally stimulate movie viewers, in order for them to hold certain perspectives on societal issues.\n",

      "Content: People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie. Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen. Others are action junkies. Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle. For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not \"get\" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people. That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly. It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray. But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done. And THAT is filmmaking at its finest. Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n",

      "Content: The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.\n",

      "Content: Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It's really not all that. It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all. That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies? Gag me.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up? Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? Freeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to prison come up with. By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I've already heard. Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come up in movies. Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison? That is classic jail movie material. Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil. How irritating",
      " If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here. Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment. The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right? The `Brooks was here' hanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite. Who hangs themselves? My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect. Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course. Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs. Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging? You know who, a character in a movie. That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.\n",

      "Content: This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.\n",

The music is great. It succeeds in showing the sadness of society, the evil greedy mind of people, the good hart of other and the happiness of living free.

Direction, screenplay and acting all are mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get an Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge mistakes sometimes(remember \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\"). In my mind I've no doubt that even if \"Avatar\", \"Titanic\", \"Return of the King\" and \"Ben Hur\" were all released in same year as this movie, the Oscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting actor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim Robbins (he is brilliant in \"The Mystic River\" too) and Morgan Freeman. Also, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of its own. It exhausts all superlatives. If you haven't watched it, watch it now. Who knows the world may end tomorrow :-).\n",

No wonder it gets the highest rated film here because the moment i reached the ending, i can only WOW it. Genius!\n",

      "Content: I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.\n",

I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  My score-10.\n",

      "Content: There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc.  It is a good enjoyable movie yes.  But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of \"everyman\" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy.  Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong.  The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before.  Is this a better prison movie than say... \"Murder in the First\"? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time.  THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that.\n",

Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway.

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.\n",

Based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly convicted of murder, and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a seasoned inmate who becomes his closest friend.Story & ThemesAt its core, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about perseverance and redemption. Andy's quiet determination and refusal to let the brutal prison system break his spirit make him an inspiring protagonist. Through his friendship with Red, the film explores themes of hope, institutionalization, and the idea that freedom is as much a state of mind as a physical reality.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing us to fully absorb the harsh realities of prison life while appreciating the small victories that keep Andy going. The narrative unfolds like a carefully crafted puzzle, with a climax that is both unexpected and deeply satisfying.PerformancesTim Robbins delivers a subtly powerful performance, portraying Andy with a quiet strength and intelligence that makes his journey compelling. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is equally remarkable, providing the film with its soulful, reflective narration. His voiceover work adds depth and warmth, making us feel as if we are living the story alongside him.The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, adds layers of conflict and tension. Each character feels authentic, contributing to the immersive world of Shawshank Prison.Cinematography & ScoreRoger Deakins' cinematography brings Shawshank Prison to life with stunning yet somber visuals. The contrast between the oppressive gray walls and moments of light-both literal and metaphorical-enhances the film's themes. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score further elevates the emotional weight of the story, particularly in key moments of triumph and despair.\n",

      "Content: This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.\n",

      "Content: In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.\n",

      "Content: This has to be one of the only films that, if not actually hitting perfection definitely brushes it.At first one would be wary of it I'm sure. A Stephen King novel about prison doesn't at first sound too stimulating (especially if you have watched Christine, a killer car cmon!) but it certainly does stimulate.Even if you cannot understand or relate to the underlying message of conformity and institutionalisation that the script is getting across it doesn't matter as the characters are believable due to high quality acting on everyones part.As my summary says perfection. The directing in this is perfect, every scene every shot seems to have been thought out to maximum potential. The acting is not over emotional like many a film is these days or not wooden like many other films are but its believable, emotions just right, every facial expression effective.Though I'm more a fan of unconventional cinema that doesn't follow the standard Todorov form of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. This still strikes a chord with me because it seems to raise it's standards above that of the classic cinema standard.All in all I will defend this movie till death as it really is one that you must watch.

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****\n",

      "Content: I'm utterly mystified at the cult of idolatry that has developed around this solid but not overly memorable prison film based on a Stephen King short story.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" came out of nowhere in 1994 to be nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and I have to believe that it's the film's underdog story that has helped it to develop such a following over the years as much as it is the quality of the film itself. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but it's overly-sentimental and obvious film-making from a director who has done nothing but make too serious film adaptations of Stephen King novels.I think it's become apparent over the years that Morgan Freeman is a one-trick pony when it comes to acting, but at the time he wasn't quite as well known, so the wise sage role he plays here seemed good enough to get him an Oscar nomination. However, it's Tim Robbins who really deserves the most praise as the man wrongly imprisoned. The less said about the actors who play the various prison personnel, the better -- they're all played as horrorshow goons.The original Stephen King story was an entertaining bit of pulp, but Frank Darabont tries to turn it into something that the story just isn't -- namely, an epic story about one man's struggle to free his soul. As a result, where the story felt sleek and satisfying, the film feels sanctimonious and bloated.Grade: B\n",

White, black, yellow, American, European, African all people meet in some ways. THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE IS SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, everyone likes it -few exceptions. I sometimes think that we are all humans that are created in a way that we love this movie (or Darabont-director is not human so he made the movie for us to love it)Go talk to others ask about films then ASK ABOUT SHAWSHANK and see the change on their features then catch the smile of people when you talk about SHAWSHANK.Some truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people (beginning as finish) (finish as beginning)\n",

      "Content: Many folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have ever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot better than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your heart out?\n",

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: \"You know that everybody in here's innocent?\" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon.\n",

When I watched it for the second time I felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. For the first time checked IMDb's top 250 movies and I amazed to see Shawshank Redemption at number two, anyway, it's number one at present.The performances of all the artists are excellent. Not a single character is waste. Especially Tim Robins excels as Andy Dufresne. Narration by Morgan Freeman is sensational. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are by far the best.

      "2. Examples of virtues the story beautifully portrays.I won't spoil the ending, but IMO, any detail about this movie is a spoiler because it's just that good. So read at your own risk.*Personal:*This film came out in 94, which was an important year for me. I had just graduated high school with no direction and saw this movie \"accidentally.\" I went to the movies with three friends. We were in line for the movie and couldn't decide on what we wanted to watch, even when we got to the window. One of my friends, frustrated at our indecision, chose \"Puppet Masters\" with Donald Sutherland and went his way. My other two friends chose Shawshank and I went with them as I could remember seeing a preview on TV and could tell that it was about something positive, though I had no idea what.I had never been so engrossed in a movie my whole life. Do you know those moments in your life when something special is happening and your mind is 100% in the moment? That's what it was like for me. Like the moment that you are rounding the bases after a home run. You're not thinking about anything else. I was hooked and took the ride.*Virtues:*What's good about the movie? Well hope is certainly the biggest message of the movie, but there's more. Think of all the greatest human virtues. They're all in the movie.Friendship: Andy and Red had the best bromance you could possibly ask for.Tenacity: \"Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of s--- and came out clean on the other side.\"Purpose: \"Prison time is slow time, so you do what you can to keep going. Some fellas collect stamps, others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it.\"Direction/Decisiveness: \"Get busy living, or get busy dying.\"Salvation: Andy is saved in every way possible. And by doing so, saves others around him also, most of all Red.Wits: When physically resisting a gang rape doesn't work, Andy goes for psychology: \"Sudden serious brain damage causes the victim to bite down hard.\"Influence/Wits: Andy provides financial advice for the captain of the guards while simultaneously getting free beer for his prison mates, thereby creating harmony on both sides.Sincerity: Andy is not a fake, about anything.Forgiveness: Though never stated, it's obvious that Red and Andy struggle with forgiving themselves for what they've done.I'm sure there are other examples.If you haven't seen the movie, watch it in the dark with no distractions. Watch without pausing if possible. Turn off your phone. Take it all in.\n",

      "Content: i had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies.\n",

      "Content: It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely?If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us.\n",

While watching it for a second time I was engrossed by the subtle hints at every stage of the movie that built up to a spectacular ending. This is a story of injustice, friendship, bonding, struggle, patience, sorrow, happiness and ingenuity – a true emotional roller coaster that covers you with a generous splattering of brutal truth. It teaches us to never give up on life and the importance of a meticulous long term plan for success. The movie is set in a different time but even a new generation of film viewers can certainly relate to the universal concepts that have been so beautifully featured in this film.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that masterfully blends themes of hope, friendship, and resilience. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 film has become one of the most beloved movies in cinematic history.The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man wrongfully convicted of a crime, and his unlikely friendship with Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. The film explores the emotional and psychological challenges of life in prison while also highlighting the strength of the human spirit.One of the film's strongest points is its stellar performances. Tim Robbins gives a subdued yet profoundly moving portrayal of Andy, a man who quietly refuses to succumb to his circumstances. Morgan Freeman, in his iconic role as Red, offers the perfect counterbalance. His voice, wisdom, and warmth provide both guidance and hope within the oppressive walls of Shawshank Prison.The direction and pacing are impeccable. Darabont crafts a story that feels intimate and grand at the same time, weaving in small moments of humanity amidst the bleakness. The cinematography is subtly beautiful, capturing the suffocating atmosphere of the prison while also highlighting moments of liberation.While the film's pacing may feel slow at times, it's this careful buildup that makes the eventual payoff so rewarding. The ending is deeply emotional and satisfying, leaving a lasting impression on viewers.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterclass in storytelling, with rich characters, profound themes, and unforgettable moments. It's a film that resonates deeply with audiences, earning it a solid 9/10.\n",

      "Title: A Shining Piece Of Cinematic Excellence\n",
      "Content: This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I didn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in screenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent very little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I think, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a \"man who can get things\", Red is instrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy Brown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense, hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every other aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to it, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing patches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.\n",

The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight.The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : \"These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.\" This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences.The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10.\n",

Morgan Freeman did an extraordinary job as Red, and Tim Robbins was just as great as Andy Dusfrene. You can watch this movie again and again and again without getting bored.

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover.The film follows Andy's journey as he adjusts to life in prison and forms a friendship with a fellow inmate, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), who acts as a mentor and father figure to Andy. Throughout the film, Andy and Red's relationship is tested as they both face challenges in the harsh prison environment.What makes The Shawshank Redemption stand out is its powerful message of hope, redemption, and the unbreakable human spirit. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver exceptional performances, with Freeman's calm and wise Red providing a strong contrast to Robbins' portrayal of the determined and optimistic Andy. The film's cinematography is stunning, with shots of the towering stone walls and dark, dreary prison interiors creating a sense of hopelessness and despair.The Shawshank Redemption is not just a prison movie; it is a movie about the human spirit, friendship, and the power of hope to sustain us in the darkest of times. It is a timeless classic that will leave a lasting impact on viewers long after the credits roll.The Shawshank Redemption is a must-watch film for anyone looking for a heartwarming and inspiring movie experience.

      "Title: Hope, friendship and redemption\n",
      "Content: As someone who loves films, The Shawshank Redemption was a necessary watch. After finally being able to see it, I can say I was not disappointed at the slightest.The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a young banker sentenced to two life terms in prison. There he befriends and bonds with Red, a long-term inmate.Written and directed by Frank Darabont, this tale of hope, friendship and redemption is widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. Solidified as IMDb's highest rated film, The Shawshank Redemption has been recognised as a culturally important universal crowdpleaser. I really enjoyed The Green Mile, another Darabont feature, but I think this film is better. The script by Darabont is absolutely fantastic. The film is filled with so many memorable scenes with well-written dialogues that will move and uplift you. The characters are so beautifully presented and developed. Despite being prisoners, Darabont manages to humanises these people and make us truly care about them. Our two main characters, Andy and Red, are played marvellously by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially outstanding due to the way he interacts with others around him and how he delivers dialogues. The scenes where he's asked if he feels rehabilitated are some of my favourite in the film as Freeman's acting in conjunction with Darabont's writing make the scene as powerful as it can be. I loved the development of Andy and Red's friendship. It was executed very well and I felt like I had a personal connection with them throughout the time they were in prison.Despite having such a simple premise, Frank Darabont is able to bring out such a powerful message about hope. The film doesn't lose sight of this theme and it's brilliantly woven throughout the story and makes a lasting impact as the film reaches its climax. He has a particular style of telling the stories he's making which manage to create a deep and emotional impact on the audience. There were points where I was reminded of The Green Mile. The film is gorgeously shot. The aerial shot of the towering Shawshank prison with Thomas Newman's amazing score playing in the background is one of the best. Newman's score landed an Oscar nomination which I found to be well deserved. His score is beautiful to listen to. It has such an uplifting tone to it that can easily generate an emotional response from the audience.The Shawshank Redemption was an incredible experience. The performances by Robbins and Freeman are oustanding and Frank Darabont really showcased his capabilities here as a writer and director. He's made a beautiful and heartfelt film that leaves a long-lasting smile on your face.\n",

      "Content: Saying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes the best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive products that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a \"happy\" occasion.All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as \"Trading Places.\" So why not make \"Trading Places\" the greatest comedy of all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's the exact same ending! Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out. But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6-7 rating that it deserves. Thusly, I hereby cast my symbolic 1-star vote.\n",

      "Content: Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time.I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250.Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump.\n",

      "Content: *** This review may contain spoilers ***\"The Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Shawshank\" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. \"Now Andy this\" and \"Andy that\". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries \"Shawshank this\" and \"Shawhank that\" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who \"looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over\" a \"tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass\". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialog was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!\n",

      "Content: There are very few films that can simply blow a human being's mind away but boy; Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get go, Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats.Tim Robbins, a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character, which always gave the impression that he had something planned, that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives, in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He maintains a streetwise wisdom and this, too me, makes him the \"go to guy\" of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape, Freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newman's compelling score sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many scores don't; it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones, to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick, and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel; I would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners, particularly Red. It would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story.Ultimately, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody.\n",

      "Content: I can't say anything about this movie other than it's a golden movie classic. I saw it for the first time the year it came out: first in theaters, then on VHS. In 2007 I bought it on bluray. And very recently I got hold of the book on which this masterpiece is based: \"Special Seasons\". It's truly amazing how a 30-sheet novel was made into one of the greatest films. To create a masterpiece - this is the pinnacle of directing and scriptwriting. Books are usually much better than movies. Why? Because you have something beautifully developed, and the director's goal is to fit it into, say, 120 minutes. A cutting begins, which finally gives birth to something that can hardly be compared to the book. Here we have clearly the opposite effect.One of the most meaningful movies. They haven't been photographed like this for a long time. A must for the younger generation as well.\n",

It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.\n",

      "Title: Nice Movie\n",
      "Content: This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.\n",

      "Content: I'm constantly amazed by the praise heaped on this film. I've always seen it as a good film, but too clichéd to rate as as truly great one.On the plus side, it has high production values, has a good performance from Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and it's well-paced until close to the end.But the downsides are legion.First of all, some of the secondary characters are utterly two-dimensional (particularly Warden Norton and Captain Hadley). They lumber through the film as such obvious and simplistic bad guys that they may as well have moustaches and wear black hats.Secondly, the film cranks out every prison cliché in the book. The assaults, the corrupt wardens, the ex-con who can't handle the outside world, the withdrawals of privileges - all have been done before and with considerably more impact.Thirdly, there are plot holes you could crawl through (as Andy does!). The notion that Andy Dufresne could dig a tunnel for 20 years without being spotted isn't up-lifting, it's ridiculous. Did no-one feel the draught? Did no-one lean against the poster when they visited him in his cell? As a resolution, it's not clever, just silly.And the finale (from the tunnel to the beach) is overlong and overwrought.And yet there are standout sequences. The scene where Andy locks himself into the Warden's office and blasts an aria from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro over the prison Tannoy is sublime and haunting.An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but no more than that.\n",

Released in 1994, the film was directed by Frank Darabont and based on a novella by Stephen King.The film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with Roger Deakins' expert use of light and shadow capturing the stark beauty of the prison environment. The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, is haunting and melancholy, perfectly complementing the tone of the film.\n",

I have seen it on various occasions and via various media. And I cannot work out why people have it in such high regard. Over. Rated. Fact. Also, the film has no air of being cool or stylish in any way - it has no wow-factor of great cinematography in the way a film like Let The Right One In has for example. It has no black humour. It is tame by comparison to other films. It has no astounding scenes which Pulp Fiction has by the truckload. It has no atmosphere which a film like The Shining has by the snow-plough load.

It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.\n",

It's based on a Stephen King novel and the tale is told in part by one of the best uses of narration in cinema history in the form of Morgan Freeman's fellow prisoner \"Red\", who charts Andy's efforts to combat the harsh regime of the sinister Warden Norton, deftly played by Bob Gunton. It's an engrossing tale that stays long in the memory ultimately as a celebration of humanity and the strength of the human spirit against impossible odds. A lovely performance too from James Whitmore as old time prisoner Brooks.\n",

      "Content: I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.Tim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.I was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.Redd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.The author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. \"The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off.\" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem!\n",

      "Content: Perfect Watch !!! The carefully crafted and brilliantly written characters, phenomenal performances along with the fantastic story intertwine to execute one of the greatest films in history.A seriously good film bringing more meaning into how important life out of prison really is and yet how scary anything all the way to being a grocer assistant can be, especially for ex-cons. This movie was studied by my English class in high school everything even down to the lighting cues and the heightened sounds resembles power: who can dominate and who can't. Outstanding Movie, stinks that they had to add the extra bit at the end, the original ending was way better. But fine, shows you that critics comments do play vital parts on a movies well being.\n",

      "Title: best movies I have ever seen\n",
      "Content: I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.\n",

      "Content: Set in the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, this film delves into the complexities of redemption and the resilience of the human spirit. As we witness the journey of Andy Dufresne, a wrongfully convicted banker, and his friendship with Ellis \"Red\" Redding, we are drawn into a world of injustice, corruption, and ultimately, triumph.The film's powerful storytelling, poignant dialogue, and breathtaking cinematography all contribute to its timeless appeal. The themes of hope, friendship, and the enduring human capacity for transformation are beautifully portrayed throughout the movie. The Shawshank Redemption does not shy away from the harsh realities of prison life, yet it also offers a glimmer of hope and redemption that shines brightly through the darkness.Moreover, the film's iconic ending is one that has left a lasting impact on viewers, as it beautifully ties together the threads of the narrative in a truly unforgettable way. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a masterpiece that continues to be celebrated for its powerful storytelling, exceptional performances, and profound messages about the indomitable nature of the human spirit.\n",

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is a good movie with great actors, a decent director, wonderful music and a very obvious plot. I think the movie would have been between mediocre and failure were it not for Robbins and Freedman.Its ranking on the IMDb top 250 is a shame. It shouldn't be on a list with other such high caliber films as the Godfather and Gone With the Wind. I think that the re-release of the DVD is the cause of its illogical high-standing.Don't get me wrong. Its a good movie its just not as good as people say. Worth watching especially if your a fan of either of the main actors.7 out of 10\n",

      "Content: There's nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies, and there's no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean, it's pretty tough to find a person that doesn't have either \"Forrest Gump\", \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people \"Forrest Gump\" is too much of a tearjerker, while \"Pulp Fiction\" apparently glorifies violence too much), \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. It's a movie that goes beyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so undeniably good that it's tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer, particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior \"The Green Mile\", characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made? It's definitely up there.\n",

      "Content: The first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine.I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory.It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope.\n",

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption - One of the greats\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful, deeply moving film that transcends the boundaries of a typical prison drama, offering a profound message of hope, resilience, and friendship. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man sentenced to life in Shawshank prison, and Ellis \"Red\" Redding, his wise, world-weary friend. Their bond and mutual support become the emotional core of the story, transforming the bleak setting into one of personal triumph and quiet rebellion.The film's pacing is perfect, allowing the viewer to become immersed in Andy's journey, from his initial despair to his quiet, unwavering determination. Roger Deakins' cinematography captures both the oppressive nature of the prison and the rare moments of beauty and freedom within it, while Thomas Newman's haunting score enhances each scene with subtle emotion and intensity.Directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption is ultimately a story of hope, revealing the strength of the human spirit even in the darkest of places. It is a timeless masterpiece, crafted with care and filled with moments that inspire and resonate deeply. This film is a must-see, celebrating the power of friendship, redemption, and the unbreakable will to survive.\n",

      "Content: The evangelical adoration this film has earned is lost on me.  Like so many popular films of recent years, \"Shawshank\" is an obvious, cliche-riddled epic that's won fans because it plays it safe.  Characters are either saintly or satanic.  There's no room for shades of gray.  Sure its sumptuously filmed.  A $50 million budget can do that.  Add the always solid Morgan Freeman, a paper-thin moral about hope, and you've got a film longing to be loved.  Obviously, plenty of people do.But compared to Freeman, Tim Robbins' vanilla performance as the long-suffering innocent (dare I say Christ-like) man trapped in purgatory comes off bland.  Clancy Brown as the sadistic prison guard is the worst cliche of the all.  When you toss in the obligatory prison rapes, the corrupt warden, and James Whitmore (who is very good) as the veteran inmate unprepared for life outside the institution, you've got a predictable film that only snaps to life near its plot-holed conclusion.Worse of all, Frank Darabont directs the works at half-speed. This is a painfully overlong concoction.In time, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" will be regarded as a well-crafted but shallow prison film.\n",

      "Content: What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale\n",

The most significant point for this film, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense and Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know leading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins played this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any awards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the most splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the morning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people suppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left. All in all nobody can deny that the biggest success was off the director of film Frank Darabont.\n",

Plain and simple.No action and effects. The truth to ultimate reality. No goofs as there's an explanation to every scene. I think every actor in the movie gave their best performances. Just awesome. Sad feeling all around but ending is awesome.Character Andy comes out to be cooler than you think he is and shows everyone this isn't it and you might think and which i thought to be so straight forward was his lucky cell location...which can certainly be overlooked because after this is what he deserved as he was innocent!\n",

      "Content: My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially  after \"green fried tomatoes\" was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me  with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars.\n",

There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.\n",

A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 film is a triumph of storytelling, acting, and direction.Set within the grim confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murder, and his unlikely friendship with fellow inmate, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Their dynamic forms the emotional core of the film, with Robbins and Freeman delivering performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. Robbins' portrayal of the stoic, enigmatic Andy is nuanced and compelling, while Freeman's narration provides a soulful and poignant backdrop to the narrative.Darabont's direction is impeccable, capturing the bleakness of prison life juxtaposed with moments of hope and camaraderie. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the viewer to become fully immersed in the characters' lives and the prison environment. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is evocative, with its muted tones and striking compositions, effectively conveying the emotional weight of the story.What sets \"The Shawshank Redemption\" apart is its profound exploration of themes such as redemption, friendship, and the enduring human spirit. It reminds us that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is room for hope and transformation. The film's climax is a tour de force, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's soul.The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the authoritarian Warden Norton and William Sadler as the tragic Heywood, deliver performances that add depth to the narrative. The screenplay, also penned by Darabont, is a testament to his skill in adapting King's work, capturing its essence while infusing it with his own vision.Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the film perfectly, underscoring the emotional resonance of each scene. The use of music is restrained, allowing the performances and storytelling to take center stage.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a film that transcends its genre, leaving an enduring impact on audiences worldwide. It's a testament to the power of cinema to move, inspire, and provoke introspection. A true classic, it continues to be celebrated and cherished, reminding us of the enduring power of hope and the possibility of redemption. This film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of storytelling at its finest.\n",

This film is above average Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to most of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.I am suspicious of most film top 100's, 10's etc etc in any case. They are as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those voting than any intrinsic value of the film.Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film uniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human condition, would do better watching Sondeburgh's highly accessible, but more profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption \"Solaris\". The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian version!\n",

      "Content: When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is an absolute masterpiece that captivates viewers with its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances. The strength of the film lies in its compelling characters, especially Andy Dufresne portrayed by Tim Robbins and Red played by Morgan Freeman. Their acting is phenomenal and brings depth and authenticity to their roles.While the movie is widely praised, it's important to note that it does have some weaknesses. The pacing can feel slow at times, and the length of the film may be a bit daunting for some viewers. Additionally, some critics argue that the plot is predictable and lacks surprises.However, the cinematography is stunning, capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere of Shawshank State Penitentiary while also showcasing the beauty of hope and redemption. The music, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the film's emotional tone, enhancing the viewers' experience.In summary, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a remarkable film that explores themes of hope, friendship, and resilience. Despite its minor flaws, the exceptional acting, cinematography, and music make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences.\n",

I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.\n",

Let's say it's the kind of entertaining stuff that makes you feel good... provided you are lenient enough to find it deep, genuinely humane, etc.So you think it's a wonderful movie? Welly welly well. Maybe I need to tell you something about cinema. [Don't take it as a lesson from an infatuated Frenchman but simply as the point of view of a cinema lover.] Cinema is about images made emotions. Hence astoundingly good movies are way above the usual recipe: (good story + good story-telling) + (good characters + good actors) = good movie.As long as it was, never did I felt emotions through images in The Shawshank Redemption. The good characters/actors/story-telling... had already killed every single spark of emotion. Especially the deadpan voice-over narration.Bottom line: Shawshank Redemption is beautifully bundled, not beautifully crafted. Guess why Tim Robbins directed Dead Man Walking the year after.\n",

All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.\n",

A viewer can accept the cliché of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the \"redemption\" is. Nothing makes any sense.\n",

If there is one movie you should see in your life its this one. It will captivate you with every sentence, every scene. Now don't have the wrong idea this is no action packed prison gangbang, This is a drama about two men and their friendship. Though it is very very entertaining.If you haven't seen this movie run to your nearest video store and pick up a copy you could probably buy it on DVD for 10 bucks and it will be the best movie in your collection.

Tim Robbins shines as Andy Dufresne, showing us the importance of holding onto hope, no matter how dark life gets. Morgan Freeman, as Red, delivers one of the most heartfelt performances I've ever seen, with his narration adding incredible depth to the story.The film is a masterpiece in storytelling, with every scene filled with meaning and purpose. It reminds us of the value of perseverance and kindness, inspiring us to believe that even in the worst circumstances, better days are possible. While it's nearly perfect, I feel a bit more focus on Andy's backstory could have added another layer of connection to his character.Still, this is a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves powerful, life-affirming cinema. I give it a solid 9/10.\n",

      "Title: An excellent film with some deep thought provoking meanings\n",
      "Content: Films that invoke volumous comments are either visually sensional, objects of media hype or emotionally stimulating. Shawshank Redemption falls into the latter category. I saw it for the first time on television, it did not need the wide screen or dramatic visual effects because it had been well-adapted from Stephen King's book to portray something that has  worried everyone at some time in their lives.  Being convicted of a crime that they did not commit and locked up for life with the very worst types of human beings.  How being institutionalised is the only way to survive, but when it ends there is no way to go, no way to return to a former life. All human existence is based on a survival instinct. Once that is destroyed, death is a welcome relief.The story hinges around three men,  one who never lost it and escaped to live again, one who nearly lost it but re-gained hope from the first and one who lost it and killed himself. Although the setting was the harsh and hostile environment of prison, it could have been any other institution, a hospital, an old peoples home even a family home.Andy Dufresne is different because he never lost the hope of escape, he used the weaknesses of others, the corruption of prison officials, the internal prison system to help his long term plan.  He had the great advantage over the others, including the Prison staff of being , intellignet knowledgable and clever. Such people always win through.  I did not know what the end was going to be, a clever piece of filming.  Although the meassage was not lost,It should give encouragement to all those who find themselves in a similar position. The justice system, although far from perfect is much improved so miscarriages can now be corrected. But I still wounder what it must feel like to be in the situation of Andy Dufresne but without his abilities.Let's have more such films that provoke the senses and emotions as this one did.  I make no excuse in adding to the hundreds of comments already make on this film , although I have not read them because I wanted mine to be original. But no doubt other thinking people would have made similar comments.  I hope that writers, producers and sponsors read these comments and take note when making more such films\n",

      "Content: Watching \"The Shawshank Redemption\" for the first time was an experience that transcended mere entertainment; it was a journey into the depths of human resilience and friendship. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by the hauntingly beautiful score and the stark yet poignant visuals of Shawshank Prison. The atmosphere was thick with despair, yet it was also laced with an undercurrent of hope that I could feel resonating within me.Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne struck a chord deep within my soul. His quiet strength and unwavering determination to maintain his dignity in the face of overwhelming adversity was nothing short of inspiring. I found myself rooting for him, feeling every moment of his struggle as if it were my own. Morgan Freeman, as Red, brought a warmth and wisdom that balanced Andy's stoicism. Their friendship was the heart of the film, a testament to the power of human connection even in the bleakest of circumstances. I often found myself reflecting on my own friendships, realizing how vital they are in navigating life's challenges.The narrative unfolded with a deliberate pace, allowing me to savor each moment. There were scenes that made me laugh, others that brought me to tears, and some that left me in contemplative silence. The film expertly showcased the harsh realities of prison life, not just the physical confinement but the psychological toll it takes on the inmates. I could feel the weight of hopelessness that many characters bore, yet the film also illuminated the possibility of redemption and the importance of holding onto hope.As the story progressed, I was struck by the profound themes woven throughout-hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit. The iconic line, \"Get busy living or get busy dying,\" resonated with me long after the credits rolled. It served as a reminder to embrace life, to strive for freedom in whatever form it may take, and to never lose sight of my dreams.By the time the film reached its conclusion, I was overwhelmed with a sense of catharsis. The final scenes left me with a bittersweet feeling, a mix of joy and melancholy that lingered in my heart. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not just a film; it's a powerful exploration of what it means to be human. It's a film I know I will revisit time and again, each viewing offering new insights and reflections on my own life. If you haven't yet experienced this masterpiece, I urge you to do so-it's a.\n",

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption: A Timeless Tale of Hope and Resilience\n",
      "Content: One of the greatest films of all time. Based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells a deeply moving story of friendship, hope, and the indomitable human spirit. While it may not have been a box office sensation upon its release, its enduring legacy and universal acclaim are a testament to its profound emotional impact and storytelling brilliance.The film follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murder, as he navigates life inside the harsh confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary. There, he forms an unlikely but profound friendship with Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned inmate known for his ability to procure contraband. Through their bond, the film explores themes of hope, resilience, and the quest for freedom, both physical and emotional.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its characters. Tim Robbins delivers a quiet yet powerful performance as Andy, a man whose calm demeanor and unwavering hope inspire those around him. Morgan Freeman, as Red, provides the film's soulful narration and a deeply human perspective on life within the prison walls. Their chemistry is the heart of the story, making their friendship feel authentic and deeply moving.\n",

      "Content: Among all the movies I've ever watched, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" stands tall as my all-time favorite. It's not just a movie - it's an emotional journey, a philosophy of life. The funny thing is, when my best friend Sukanto Deb Nath Suvro first recommended it to me, I wasn't that interested. I thought, \"A prison story? How exciting could that really be?\"But the day I finally decided to watch it, I got so immersed that I lost track of time. It felt like I was inside Shawshank prison myself, sitting with Andy and Red, listening to their stories, dreaming of freedom.The most captivating thing about this movie is how it reshapes our understanding of hope and resilience. Andy's character is unbelievably inspiring - it feels like no matter how tough life gets, there's always a way out. That iconic line, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies,\" isn't just a quote - it's a belief that sticks with you.Another brilliant aspect is the suspense. When Andy's grand escape plan is revealed, it hits you like a storm - \"Oh my God, how did he pull this off?\" That's the genius of the movie - it keeps you hooked till the very last second, leaving you in awe.Honestly, if Sukanto hadn't pushed me to watch it, I might've missed this masterpiece. So I owe him big time for recommending a true cinematic gem.If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait any longer. Once you start, time will fly by, and you'll find yourself lost in an unforgettable journey with Andy and Red.If you want to truly understand the meaning of hope, friendship, and freedom, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the perfect movie.Rating: 10/10 - Not just a movie, but a life-changing experience.\n",

The way it explores themes of hope, friendship, and resilience in the face of adversity is truly inspiring.Tim Robbins delivers a stunning performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully imprisoned, and his journey through despair to eventual triumph is both heartbreaking and uplifting.

Each scene is meticulously crafted, creating a rich tapestry of humanity, struggle, and redemption.What truly stands out is the film's message: no matter how bleak the situation may seem, hope is a powerful force that can lead to liberation. The ending leaves you with a sense of joy and reflection that lingers long after the credits roll.In a world filled with fleeting entertainment, The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless gem that resonates deeply, reminding us of the strength of the human spirit. It's a film that deserves to be watched and cherished over and over again. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this extraordinary story!\n",

Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new.  The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick.  It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.  Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!!  Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes.  But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene.  There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness.

      "Title: **1/2 (Out of four)\n",
      "Content: Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a film of pretentious platitudes and obvious intentions.  Based on Stephen  King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\", the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly accused of murdering his adulterous wife and her lover.  Morgan Freeman delivers a much-deserved Academy-Award nominated performance as the hardened Red, the convict responsible for smuggling cigarettes into the penitentiary whose genuine depth allows him to form a friendship with Andy not based on the macho rules of the prison yard (Andy's demeanor is in face so falsely naive that many of the prisoners bet on him to be the first under pressure) but on a continuing sense of willpower and motivation in a place that genuinely lacks the atmosphere for such human emotions.And yet whereas \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is in itself an honorable predilection of prison life and shows an understanding of the human spirit which is somehow lacking in the more recent prison movies (most notably Tom Selleck's \"An Innocent Man\" and Sylvester Stallone's \"Lock Up\"), the film is deemed exceptional only by your willingness to surrender to Darabont's predictable machinations.  Darabont may be a talented screenwriter, and some of his creations here (such as the character played by William Sadler, who comes across during an inventory inspection a copy of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexander...Dumbass) are unmistakeably human, his portrayal of the Bible-thumping warden (Bob Gunton) cannot resist but to relegate itself to stereotype. The film's real downfall is in Tim Robbins' performance, who despite his squeaky-clean cherub face cannot project the inspiration needed to give this film its realistic element.  And yet this is not a bad movie, just certainly not the best movie of all time.  Some images of the movie will continue to stay with me: the cold-hearted sexual depravity of \"the Sisters\"; and in the infamous shot beautifully and rigidly painted by cinematographer Roger Deakins (\"Fargo\"), Dufresne basking in a downpour upon entering freedom. Unfortunately, the film isn't cohesive enough to warrant any more of those moments.\n",

      "Content: I remember watching this film as a teenager, under the open sky in an outdoors film screening. No film has ever produced a greater impression on me than that viewing of the Shawshank Redemption - so atmospheric, gruesome and triumphant it was.The story catches the viewed by surprise and on immediately becomes highly sympathetic with the main character played by Andy Dufresne. You just can't believe how wrong the life is treating him until... He did have to meet someone to reflect his perseverance and to motivate him for taking the redemption. This is the masterful Morgan Freeman. The ending, though a long way to hope, brings hope and just makes you watch it again. Enjoy!\n",

      "Content: Before Shawshank, the only good adaptations were of Misery and Stand By Me.I'm sure I'm not the first person, nor will I be the last, to claim this is one of the best films ever made. One reliable indicator of this is a film's position on IMDb. As of now, it ranks third, but it has the potential to be number one. Given that we already agree that the movie is fantastic, I won't bother with the usual effusive praise. And if I may add, Stephen King's pen was what really piqued my interest in Shawshank.In today's fast-paced digital world, whiteboard drawing has become a very useful way to communicate. This interesting method uses hand-drawn images and pictures to make complicated ideas and concepts easier for people of all backgrounds to understand and remember.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that \"Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies\".\n",

      "Title: Life in Shawshank\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is the 1994 movie about the banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins). Andy finds himself being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and her lover. After being convicted of both murders, Andy is sentenced to two life sentences at the dark Shawshank Penitentiary. He is mostly a quiet man and only talks to a few men in prison. Early on, Andy meets Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). Red is the man in prison who can get things from the outside and knows how the prison runs. He may be a step above the inmates and a step below the guards, but deals with both to keep everyone satisfied. Throughout Andy's years in prison, he has many projects that he works on, starting on maybe the hardest--surviving. From the very beginning of his incarceration, Andy has to fight off the prison gang 'The Sisters' who try to isolate Andy so the can sexually have their way with him. After the leader is finally taken care of by the guards, Andy is left alone to work on other ventures. Andy decides to take up an old hobby and start carving rocks in chess pieces by using the rock hammer he received from Red. He is later given an office job of assistant librarian after doing taxes for the warden and all the prison guards. During these years, Andy writes to state legislators to get the prison money for a better library and helps many inmates receive a high school education. Andy soon finds out that the warden is corrupt and helps him launder money, but makes sure the warden doesn't find out about his plans that he is willing to carry out at the end of the movie. This is very dark movie and shows both the good and bad sides of living out a life sentence. The movie has a message about how some men become part of the prison and cannot live without it. It shows that people can get mentally attached to the worst the world has to offer.\n",

It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldn't find any flaw, the direction, script, acting, production values, and acting. What I like about this movie is that's all about humans, it's about the simple human needs that we seek, freedom, love, respect, power, friendship, health, fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference, it will touch you so deep!\n",

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it.

Which is why you can see i rated it pretty low, as compare to God father or God father 2.One of the factors affecting my rating is the speed of the movie and the plot,it is little diverted and you are not quite sure to understand what the guy is up to.

      "Title: Believe the hype\n",
      "Content: On the outside, Frank Darabont's directorial piece de resistance does not look promising: Scripts purloined from little-known Stephen King novellas, hacked up and padded with sentimental Hollywood schmaltz do not tend to yield cinematic gold. King, a master of unnerving, psychological drama would never be so trite as to tag one of his stories with a vague, syrupy axiom like 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'  that kind of corny meddling smacks of the ad men tugging mercilessly at the heart strings, ripping the freshness and originality out of every project they come across. I am also immediately wary of prison melodramas (especially those with the word 'redemption' in the title)  they are all so predictable.These were my thoughts as I first contemplated watching The Shawshank Redemption almost a decade ago. Then there was nothing like the hype and fervour that surround the movie now. I had only the rapturous, breathless testimony of a friend of mine to go on, and he was something of a philistine when it came to the pictures (I believe his previous favourite film was Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, so you can forgive my scepticism).Still I did some research before going in: Yup, thought so: Idealistic young man, banged up for a crime he didn't commit  I'll bet he soon bears the brunt of some pent-up sexual aggression from his misanthropic fellow inmates. What's that? He befriends an institutionalised black guy played by Morgan Freeman? I would imagine he'll be providing a wise voice-over throughout, perhaps whimsically tinged with an ingenuous Southern drawl. And the Warden: He'll be a stern, God-fearing fellow with steel-rimmed spectacles and a shady secret.I went along and watched it anyway of course (my social diary as a teenager was hardly cram-full) and as I sat, I soon realized I was right on all counts. But still I watched. Past the grim depictions of new recruits being raped and beaten by both guard and lag; past the scene on the roof with the insurance advice and the ice-cold beers; past the bittersweet tale of Brooksy's freedom and Tommy Williams' fateful revelations. I watched through the ever-changing posters on Andy Dufresne's wall, and at the end I, like everybody else in the cinema emerged blinking, dry-of-mouth and my heart soaring.Teenagers aren't supposed to be awash with optimism and joy. They slouch and scowl and lock themselves in their rooms with the stereo on full blast, but, despite myself, I couldn't take the big soppy grin off my face or shake the shiver from my spine. After watching The Shawshank Redemption, I smiled so hard my cheeks ached.Because what cynical young sods like me didn't realize was that some films are formulaic for a reason. You cannot reinvent the wheel every time. What I also learnt was that redemption (when it is done right) can be the most moving and satisfying cinematic theme of them all. Shawshank excels in its simplicity. It is by no means the only great prison drama: Cool Hand Luke oozes, well",
      " cool, but the young Paul Newman was such a screen god that the film ends up being more of a slavish homage. Other prison revenge flicks (Murder in the First and Sleepers spring to mind) are more obsessed with action or courtroom finger pointing than any thoughtful resolution and the protagonists are bitter and angry.Not here. The characterisation is crisp yet understated. Tim Robbins' Dufresne draws empathy and respect in equal measure, while Freeman's Red has an extraordinary dignity. When we meet him, he has served 20 years for a murder he committed as a kid and any angst and aggression has gradually ebbed away. Now he is revered as 'a man who can get things.' Inside his ability to procure contraband has made him influential  much more so than he ever was as a free man  but instead of using it to bully and menace his fellow cons, he sits back in quiet reflection. This is Red's redemption.Dufresne meanwhile has a grander plan and it comes to fruition in the most splendid fashion. Unusually, we see it all through Red's eyes and that leaves us as wide-eyed and incredulous as the warden after he throws the pebble through Raquel Welsh's midriff.I am not usually in favour of the retrospective voice-over. It is a lazy, mawkish device that is all to often used to paper over plot holes or lack of imagination. This one is different. I suppose it is all in the voice and Freeman sounds like he has been gargling with a heady mixture of rich New England soil and spitting whiskey. It is quiet but wholly convincing  much more so than his subsequent authoritative Presidential ramblings in Deep Impact. The language he uses is easy and uncomplicated but breathtakingly effective:'His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound,' he says when the new convict refuses to buckle, wryly encapsulating the intricacies of a friendship based on a mutual respect and true affection.Who will ever forget Red as an old man 'so excited I can hardly sit still or hold a thought in my head' as he shuffles along the stone wall in the cornfield towards the big oak tree and Andy's hidden treasure  a true moment of silver screen magic. 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin',' is the final maxim, and by that stage, no matter how cold or hard-nosed you purport to be, I defy you not to have a lump in your throat. Maybe for once the ad men got it right.10/10\n",

      "Title: Awesome, gripping film - gold-plated classic\n",
      "Content: This is a story about patience, maturity, character, salvation, and ultimately about finding humanity in a place where there is none. Although its subject matter may be depressing, the story actually contains a lot of warmth, humor and friendship - a buddy story cloaked in a philosophical discourse on the importance of retaining a sense of personal worth and hope no matter what the circumstances.This adaptation of a 1982 Stephen King novella did lukewarm box office, in part because of an advertising campaign that offered no clue as to what the movie was about, and in part because it never played on more than 970 screens. Still it garnered seven Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture nod, and finished up at a respectable $30 million.Set in mid-1940s Maine, this is the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is tried and falsely convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets a canny lifer named Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and a caravan of colorful characters.The story begins with Red and his fellow inmates watching the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red narrates the story from within the walls of the prison.Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or trashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds through fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love story even more audience-friendly. The film sports elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a poignant score by Thomas Newman, solid portrayals and characterizations by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and an excellent supporting cast including James Whitmore (as old-timer Brooks Hatlen) and William Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable.\n",

      "Title: 10/10\n",
      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" stands as a cinematic masterpiece, weaving a tapestry of emotions, resilience, and redemption that resonates with audiences on a profound level. Released in 1994 and directed by Frank Darabont, this film has not only stood the test of time but has also solidified its place in the annals of cinema as one of the greatest works ever created.At its core, the film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella, \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.\" The narrative unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, where Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) finds himself serving a life sentence for a crime he vehemently denies committing. The plot meticulously navigates the harsh realities of prison life, exploring themes of friendship, institutionalization, and the indomitable human spirit.One of the film's most striking features is its impeccable storytelling. Darabont crafts a narrative that is both intricate and accessible, allowing viewers to connect with the characters on a deeply personal level. The storytelling is layered, with multiple threads weaving seamlessly together. The use of voiceover narration, delivered by Red (Morgan Freeman), adds a contemplative and reflective dimension, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.The film's pacing is another noteworthy aspect. Darabont takes his time to establish the characters and the prison environment, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in the world of Shawshank. The deliberate pacing also serves to heighten the impact of key moments, creating a visceral experience for the viewer. The film's nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime feels justified as every scene contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative.Central to the film's success is the stellar performances of its cast. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy Dufresne, capturing the character's quiet strength and unwavering determination. Morgan Freeman's performance as Red is equally remarkable, providing the film with its soul through his poignant narration and portrayal of a seasoned inmate with a keen understanding of the prison's dynamics.The supporting cast, including William Sadler as Heywood, Bob Gunton as the oppressive Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown as the menacing Captain Hadley, contribute to the film's authenticity. Each actor brings depth to their characters, making them more than mere archetypes and allowing the audience to empathize with their struggles and triumphs.The cinematography, spearheaded by Roger Deakins, is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual composition of each frame is meticulously crafted, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. The use of light and shadow is particularly noteworthy, symbolizing hope and despair respectively. From the sweeping shots of the prison yard to the intimate moments in Andy's cell, every scene is a visual feast that complements the storytelling.Thomas Newman's evocative score further elevates the film. The music seamlessly weaves through the narrative, underscoring the emotional beats with precision. The now-iconic theme, \"Shawshank Redemption,\" has become synonymous with the film itself, evoking a range of emotions from nostalgia to inspiration.Beyond its technical brilliance, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a film with a profound message. At its core, it is a tale of resilience and the enduring power of hope. Andy's relentless pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement, even within the confines of Shawshank, serves as a testament to the human spirit's capacity to transcend adversity. The film inspires introspection, urging viewers to reflect on their own lives and the choices that define them.The theme of friendship is woven throughout the narrative, primarily through the bond between Andy and Red. This relationship serves as the emotional anchor of the film, illustrating how genuine connections can provide solace and strength even in the bleakest of circumstances. The camaraderie among the inmates, forged through shared hardship, adds another layer of depth to the film's exploration of human relationships.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" also serves as a poignant critique of the prison system and the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization. Through the lens of Andy's experiences, the film sheds light on the arbitrary nature of justice and the challenges faced by those within the system. The corrupt practices within Shawshank, epitomized by Warden Norton, highlight the moral ambiguity that can permeate positions of authority.Furthermore, the film tackles themes of redemption and forgiveness. As the title suggests, Shawshank becomes a metaphorical crucible for redemption, where characters grapple with their past actions and seek a path to personal salvation. The conclusion of the film is a testament to the transformative power of redemption, offering a cathartic resolution that lingers in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a cinematic triumph that transcends its prison setting to deliver a universal message of hope, friendship, and the indomitable nature of the human spirit. Through its masterful storytelling, exceptional performances, and profound themes, the film continues to resonate with audiences, earning its place as a timeless classic in the pantheon of great cinema.\n",

      "Content: This movie is ridiculously overrated on this list, and I think that I know why. This is the kind of movie that appeals to men who feel like they are wimpy and can't get over, but, in this movie, are able to get over. I'm sorry that we men have to worry so much about our manhood.Anyway, Andy Dufresne is such a character. He takes all kinds of abuse, but still gets over in the end. The story is somewhat interesting, but King's characters tend to be superficial, and you only find out about them through anecdotes and action rather than through emotional expression (except perhaps Dolores Claiborne). Darabont doesn't do much to fill them out. Who is Red outside of the anecdotes? I only relate to him through Andy, who seems to be pretty one-dimensional as well. With the long, progressive story, there should be better character development, but no. I feel that these characters are kept at arms length, unless they are getting hammered or getting over. Not satisfying to me.This morality play goes on too long and is not paced particularly well, though the ending is satisfying, and there are moments of true pathos. The acting is good but not exceptional. The narration holds things together, but becomes tiresome. The best thing about it is the cinematography, which is quite exceptional. Roger Deakins is a powerhouse.There are loads of movies that cover similar ground (such as \"Emperor of the North\" or \"Cool Hand Luke\") and come out much better. I've happened to see it twice now, and overall, I'd give about a 6/10.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.\n",

      "Title: One Of The Most Powerful Movies.\n",
      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" stands as a towering achievement in cinematic history, a film that transcends mere storytelling to explore the profound depths of the human spirit. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" this film is not just a narrative about imprisonment; it is a powerful meditation on hope, resilience, and the indomitable strength of the human will.From the moment the film opens, we are drawn into the haunting world of Shawshank State Penitentiary, a place where despair seems to reign supreme. Yet, through the eyes of Andy Dufresne, played masterfully by Tim Robbins, we witness a journey that transforms not only his life but also the lives of those around him. Robbins delivers a performance that is both nuanced and deeply affecting, capturing the essence of a man who, despite being wrongfully imprisoned, refuses to let the circumstances define him.Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis \"Red\" Redding is equally compelling. Freeman brings a depth of emotion and wisdom to the character, serving as both narrator and friend to Andy. Their bond forms the heart of the film, illustrating the power of friendship in the darkest of times. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is palpable, creating moments of joy, sorrow, and profound connection that resonate long after the credits roll.The film's direction and cinematography are nothing short of extraordinary. Darabont expertly crafts each scene with meticulous attention to detail, using shadows and light to reflect the inner turmoil of the characters. The haunting score by Thomas Newman enhances the emotional weight of the story, elevating key moments to unforgettable heights.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a triumph of storytelling, blending themes of hope, redemption, and the quest for freedom into a narrative that feels timeless. Its message is clear: no matter how bleak the circumstances, hope is a powerful ally that can inspire change and resilience. The film's iconic line, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,\" encapsulates its essence and serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of places, hope can shine through.This film has not only garnered critical acclaim but has also solidified its status as one of the most beloved films of all time, consistently ranking at the top of audiences' favorite lists. Its impact is undeniable, resonating with viewers across generations and inspiring countless discussions about the nature of hope, friendship, and the human condition.In conclusion, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is more than just a movie; it is an experience that lingers in the heart and mind. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a celebration of friendship, and a powerful reminder that hope can flourish even in the most oppressive environments. It is a film that deserves every bit of its acclaim-a true masterpiece that will continue to inspire and move audiences for years to come. 10/10, without question.\n",

      "Title: WATCH THE GODFATHER INSTEAD. The most overrated film of all time\n",
      "Content: In a world where films like The Godfather, 2001 A Space Odyssey, There Will Be Blood, Birdman exist, this above average Steven King adaptation tops the IMDb list and lowers the standards of Hollywood cinema for generations of movie viewers who only have time for what society, manifested in questionable IMDb ratings, deem \"the best films of all time\".While a fantastic film, Shawshank Redemption does not hold a candle to 80% of the Top 100 films in this list. It is an anomaly that it attains such a high score, which is presumably to be the result of initial falsified ratings aggrandized by cinema neophytes who don't know how great movies can be. Snowball effect ensues.There are great aspects to this movie. Morgan Freeman's acting, Roger Deakins' cinematography, Thomas Newman's score. The lead and director were relatively obscure, but they did fine. The story is as average as films of its calibre can get. While it would certainly be a highlight of the legendary year of 1994 (second greatest year in cinema behind 1999), I CANNOT comprehend the notion that it is the best film of all time. It missed out on every critics poll list.This movie ain't that great y'all. Skip this and dig further down into the list if you want the real gems. The Godfather is truly a 10/10.\n",

      "Content: This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.\n",

      "Content: It took me 10 years to see this movie; I dated a guy who constantly talked about it 7 years ago; but I never did see it. I am not into prison movies; so I kept telling him I didn't want to see it. Whenever it came on television, I would go into another room and watch something else. I just thought he liked it because he has been in prison before; and it reminded him of being in there or something (silly me).But, this Labor Day Weekend (2005); when it came on again; I decided to sit down and just look at it for the first time. Well; was I pleasantly surprised and glad that I did finally see it. Great plot, good direction, characters that had some depth and the surprise ending too boot. Also, just to be able to see Morgan Freeman act is a treat me for anyway; he is such a great actor. He finally won the Academy Award that he so richly deserved all of these years for Million Dollar Baby. He got robbed of the Academy Award for \"Driving Ms. Daisy\" and for \"Lean on Me\"; but he finally got what was due him.I also liked Tim Robbins portrayal of his character, as he was quiet, and smart. You know, being quiet sometimes can help a person get through many difficult ordeals in their life. Folks have a tendency to ignore you and don't pay much attention to you then. I learned how to be quiet and not so loud all the time; thinking is better than talking in certain situations.Before I saw this move, I was not being treated well at work by my boss, and struggling with how to handle it. Seeing this movie actually helped me to do something positive about it. My boss and my job will never be the same.Andy was right; we need to get along with the business of living or the business of dying; and living is much better.P.S. I broke up with the guy I was dating 7 years ago; he was a jerk.Sanctified Minister Chicago, IL\n",

      "Content: Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw \"The Shawshank Redemption\", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, \"Shawshank\" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time.\n",

Yes, the story is good, as is the setting of the film. But is this the best thing that the world has created in more than a century of work? Is that what worries people? The most pressing?

In recent years, however, there's a growing legion of cineastes singling out this film as the best, if not, one of the best of all time.This movie is the perfect example of a masterpiece way ahead of its time. Take it as Beethoven's Symphony #5 of cinema. Years go by and the echo of its message gets louder and becomes even more relevant. It's about how we are defined by the establishment's greed and corruption.It's about how we have forgotten our humanity.It's about why our possessions, especially money, continue to deny us of the ever-elusive happiness we all yearn for.It's about our capability to love our fellowmen under any circumstances.Most importantly, it's about life as a matter of choice and how we can outdo the fear that imprisons us in misery. If only we tap our power from within. As its main message suggests, \"Fear can hold us prisoner. Hope can set us free.\"The Shawshank Redemption is a must for those undergoing severe depression. It keeps us glued to our seats while all of its elements seem to magnify the message of hope, love AND yes...redemption.With a budget of $25 million, it earned only $58 million. It had 7 Oscar nominations but won nothing. NADA.It is underrated and over qualified.However, it has been #1 on IMDb's user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather. In my opinion, this is the best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman must be honoured with the best performance of all time.My criteria: unlike The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption does not only grip the viewer's heart. It zaps the audience to boldly declare: LIFE IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL!Don't ever blame me if you fail to see this movie after this post. I warned you.\n",

Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\n",

I went to work today and earned some extra cash. Who doesn't love extra cash? I mean, come on! This is America, people! If you don't love extra cash, then you're not American! Anyways, I went to work today and then after that I went home and checked some stuff off of my checklist, after which I am writing this review. I never did tell you why I needed ti write this review, did I? I probably should, as not to completely waste your time (although I've wasted it a lot already). I am writing this review because IMDb wants me to do a checklist of things to \"Complete My Account\". It's really stupid if you ask me, but I've now written more that 10 lines of text so I will bid you farewell :)\n",

      "Content: This movie is absolutely fine. It is very well made. Great acting. Great cinematography. Tight script and interesting complex characters. That being said, it's a bit contrived. The bad guys are just a little too bad and the good guys just a little too good. The moral is a little obvious and telegraphed. It's fun in parts, but honestly a little uncomfortable in parts that doesn't really make up for the relative lack of realism. I wouldn't say this movie is unrealistic, but it's contrived in a very obvious way. It feels \"written\" not lived. Now I know this movie is beloved, and it is a very well made movie, without question, but the kind of obvious nature of the story makes this personally for me not one of the greats, but one of the goods. I am happy its found an audience, though.\n",

      "Title: Remember Hope is a good thing.\n",
      "Content: Finally I Watched \"Shawshank Redemption.\" Well, Last night I watched a movie which has most un-believable rating on world's most trusted movie rating site, IMDb with a rating of 9.3 by more than 800,000 votes (yes!). I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by \"Leo Tolstoy\". It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. \"Hopes Never Die.\" I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one of the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, \"Get busy living or get busy dying.\" And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it like a blind-head Ass. Lol :) Remember Hope is a good thing.\n",

      "Content: It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget. The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\n",

What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn't like was how after \"The Sisters\" leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.A great addition to your DVD collection.\n",

      "Content: One of the best stories on film. Acting, cinematography... it's all in there. A must see. A piece of our history as filmmakers.This story is compelling as you feel for each characters' deep struggles within a community of inmates. A range of characters excite the plot with its unexpected culture as an intimate story unfolds of secrets, shame, struggle and finally triumph. Morgan Freeman deserves an Oscar for his amazing performance and Tim Robbins executes his character flawlessly as Andy Dufresne, a man of clever who navigates his way through a sharp turn to a new way of life. This story isn't missing a morsel and keeps you on the edge of your seat with mystery, murder and the element of surprise.The Shawshank Redemption shares the ranks of the best feature screenplay I have ever read. It read unlike any other and was the kind you can't put down. Saving Private Ryan comes in at a close second. Frank Darabont is a hell of a writer and is also credited with The Green Mile and developed The Walking Dead series.\n",

      "Title: Not bad, but Seriously Overrated\n",
      "Content: This is not a bad film, and I would recommend renting it. But its admirers who rank it as one of the best films of all time -- even above classics like Citizen Kane or The Godfather -- are seriously overrating it.The popularity of this film apparently comes from its uplifting message about the power of hope. Nothing else in Shawshank Redeption is extraordinary. The acting is only good: indeed, Tim Robbins's acting of Andy Dufresne is two-dimensional. Morgan Freeman is much better as Red. The photography is unremarkable. Most seriously, however, the moral dilemmas in this film are melodramatic and black-and-white. Andy Dufresne is impossibly noble. The guards and, especially, the warden are unbelievably evil and corrupt. It's nice to think a prison would be reformed by building a nice library. But sorry, folks, the world is more complicated than that. At best, this film can be enjoyed as a kind of uplifting fable, a sort of fairy-story for adults. Nobody struggles with the ambiguities and complexities of real life in this film, and so the \"redemption\" it offers is false.As a point of comparison, take another film in this \"criminal redemption\" genre -- Dead Man Walking, a film, significantly, by Tom Robbins. Here is real, tough, moral drama. Can we forgive the Shawn Penn character? Is his redemption real? The film poses these questions without answering them. Plus the acting is rich and nuanced, the direction riveting. Dead Man Walking is much better film than Shawshank Redemption because it's about real life.\n",

      "Content: Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations.\n",

      "Content: Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film, it's a masterclass in storytelling and an ode to the resilience of the human spirit. Based on Stephen King's short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie gracefully combines raw emotion, profound themes and impeccable performances earning its rightful place among cinema's greatest masterpieces. Tim Robbins delivers a quietly powerful performance, bringing depth and nuance to Andy's character. Morgan Freeman, as Ellis \"Red\" Redding, provides the film's emotional core narrating with a voice that feels like a warm embrace. Their on-screen friendship is both moving and authentic, a testament to the power of connection even in the bleakest circumstances. Darabont's direction is masterful, capturing the oppressive atmosphere of Shawshank with a perfect balance of grit and humanity. The cinematography by Roger Deakins, especially the iconic shot of Andy standing in the rain after his escape is breathtaking. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score underscores every moment, lingering in the viewer's mind long after the credits roll. The film's themes of hope, perseverance and the human capacity for change resonate universally. It's a reminder that even in the darkest places a glimmer of light can lead to freedom, whether physical or emotional. The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a prison drama, it's a life-affirming story that stays with you. If you haven't yet experienced this cinematic gem, do yourself a favor and watch it. As Red wisely says, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.\"\n",

      "Title: Inspiration can come where you least expect it\n",
      "Content: You go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can expect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire then you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale of...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound particularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will surprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem hopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content to sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there ever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular amongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things. Most of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the big item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to maintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth poster. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes Raquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time marches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left behind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold guilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne? You wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he maintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something about this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story is never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his friend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And for this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the role of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps the more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as the audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice. Extensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy proposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's voice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off one another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This is a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and talk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But some of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any you'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for making it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly proceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in letting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's story, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to carve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly prisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little story within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course for any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for that we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least Hadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's biggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all the while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a man who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton who has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very unhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to prevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards something. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But when the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph is secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly compelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you feel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need to have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as it is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is an undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather beloved by most everyone who sees it.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is presently the highest rated movie on IMDb. It follows a man who is wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison for multiple years because of it. The prison, Shawshank, is a prison which acts outside of the law and ends up being very brutal because of it. For the most part it's pretty deserving of its rating, but it's definitely not the best movie ever made in my opinion.The plot of this movie is pretty great. It's interesting and somewhat unique, and it actually throws you off a little. It's a movie that isn't horribly plot-driven, but nonetheless is very interesting.The characters are the driving force of the movie, and they were very good. They all feel pretty realistic, and the actors are all fantastic.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie. While I wouldn't call it the best movie ever, or even put it close to that place, it's a very well-made movie that I enjoyed quite a lot. There isn't a lot I can really say about it. Everything about this movie is great, and if I were to go any deeper I'd probably end up spoiling something. In the end I'd recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's a movie that you should just watch and see what you think for yourself.\n",

The storyline drags on endlessly, offering little in terms of originality or excitement. The characters are one-dimensional, and the performances lack depth. I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping for some redeeming quality that never materialized. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this overhyped relic of cinema.Despite its acclaim, \"Shawshank Redemption\" feels like a tedious slog rather than a captivating cinematic experience. The narrative unfolds at a snail's pace, failing to maintain viewer engagement throughout its lengthy runtime. The characters, supposedly complex, come across as caricatures lacking authenticity and depth. Even the supposedly climactic moments fall flat, devoid of emotional resonance. While some may find solace in its themes of hope and redemption, I found them clichéd and uninspired. Ultimately, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is a forgettable film that hardly warrants its revered status in cinematic history.\n",

      "Content: Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a good movie. It has a solid cast, a solid script, and solid cinematography. The film is at times engaging, moving and thrilling. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything particularly wrong with it.But that doesn't make it a great movie.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of story, but in how it's executed. Frank Darabont directs the film competently, and seems content to stay at that level the whole time. Roger Deakins, possibly the best cinematographer working today, seems to be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Thomas Newman provides an unmemorable score. Everyone seems to be operating at three- quarters cylinder, enough to be good, but never enough to be amazing.This extends to most of the performances. Tim Robbins as the wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne is not a particularly engaging lead. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are fun in antagonistic roles, but they've both given much better performances. The ensemble cast of prisoners is game, but very few of them are given much to do.The standout performance is easily Morgan Freeman's Red, who helps Andy navigate life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, and that has more to do with Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman than it does anything to do with the role.There is little wrong with \"The Shawshank Redemption\". But it takes more than having nothing wrong to make a great film. A great film requires risky decisions, new ideas or masters of their craft bringing their A-game. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has none of these, and that's not a bad thing. It's a decent film. Just not a masterpiece.\n",

      "Content: In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job.The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book.The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.\n",

I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb\n",

      "Content: I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).Basically it's a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job?It's okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie:1 - The escape plan: It's silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you're expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It's roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts.\n",

      "Content: One of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.\n",

I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives.\n",

      "Content: \" This is a must-see movie for men.\" Everyone says so. However, simply distinguishing it by gender would make the movie rather narrow. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has broken through the limitations of a so-called \"men's movie\". Almost the whole film is filled with an incredibly warm tone, and the greatest theme in the movie is \"hope\". When we helplessly encounter a prison that imprisons the freedom of our souls just like Shawshank, will we be the helpless old Brooks, the disheartened Red, or the wise Andy? Should we use our wisdom, trust in hope, and bravely face our fears and defeat them? Classic movies are classic because they are all doing the same thing - enabling you to appreciate the beauty of hope from different perspectives.\n",

      "Content: This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.What an inspiring and overrated movie.\n",

      "Content: How precious is a person's life? Is putting away people for ungodly amounts of time for a mistake the right way to dabble with the issue of the threat they pose?I know little about incarceration and such issues but am pulled to think there's a better way than tossing in the trash the ONE life people have, indulging in our negligence to better them, regardless of the crime (though there's clearly harsh outliers), it's definietly a complex issue.We're shown a heartbreaking scene of a kind of hell we humans have agreed upon. Decade after decade of rejections for freedom just strike a chord in me, I think of how mistaken I was about something I did some time ago and how I've changed as a person in a reasonably short amount of time and to extrapolate that situacion to someone facing long prision time is just soul crushing.That's the feeling that gripped me through my first watch, the horror of having time dillute within those walls as your youth and potential fade away. Hopefully hummanity moves towards a state where true rehabilitation is achievable within no more than a couple years, with the right tools, psychoterapy, love and understanding I don't think it's too delusional of an idea, for a good part of those who've lost their freedom anyways.Nonetheless, the ability of the characters to navigate the horrible hand they've been dealt and to find meaning through friendship and hope is envigorating, forced to look at the long road ahead and make up their mind on how to approach it, with an undying desire to see another day, a better day.Both sad and inspiring film, mellow, tender and rewarding.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that captures the essence of the human spirit in a way that stays with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, it beautifully tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man wrongfully imprisoned, and his journey through despair and, ultimately, hope.What makes Shawshank extraordinary is its deep exploration of friendship, freedom, and resilience. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of \"Red\" is simply iconic, bringing wisdom and warmth to every scene. Together, Robbins and Freeman create a chemistry that feels real and grounded, adding a profound emotional layer to the film.The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the prison world and understand the bonds that form there. Darabont's direction and the screenplay manage to make the film's 142-minute runtime feel essential; there is no filler, only scenes that add depth and meaning to the narrative.The cinematography captures both the bleakness and beauty of the Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's score is haunting and unforgettable. The themes of hope, redemption, and perseverance resonate universally, making The Shawshank Redemption not just a story about prison life but about life itself.Ultimately, this film is a testament to the enduring power of hope and friendship. Even though it's over two decades old, it remains relevant and moving, proving that a story well told can truly be timeless. It's no wonder that it's regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.Rating: 10/10.\n",

      "Rewatching The Shawshank Redemption reaffirms my belief that it is the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. This film is a flawless blend of harsh realism and uplifting hope, making it an enduring masterpiece. Frank Darabont's direction is nothing short of brilliant, especially considering this was his first theatrically released film. His skill is evident in every meticulously crafted scene.The casting is impeccable. Every actor embodies their character so convincingly that they feel like real people. The adaptation of Stephen King's short story is handled masterfully, maintaining the essence of the original while expanding its emotional and visual depth for the big screen.Thomas Newman's score deserves special mention. It beautifully enhances the film's emotional impact, adding layers to the narrative without overpowering it. The film manages to be brutal, heartbreaking, uplifting, and even humorous at times - a rare feat that Shawshank achieves effortlessly.The depiction of individuals at their lowest points, facing despair, and then finding that spark of resilience is profoundly moving. Morgan Freeman's narration pulls you deeper into the story, and his chemistry with Tim Robbins is nothing short of perfect. However, I always find myself drawn to James Whitmore's portrayal of Brooks. His scenes outside the prison are particularly poignant and perfectly executed.The film's deliberate pace allows you to truly connect with the characters and their journeys. It's a masterclass in storytelling and visual artistry, showcasing the incredible power of film to convey complex emotions and narratives.No matter how many times I watch The Shawshank Redemption, it never loses its impact. It's a timeless gem that continues to resonate deeply, reminding me why it stands as a monumental achievement in filmmaking. For me, this film is perfectuon, capturing the essence of what makes cinema great.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0\n",

Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script. But i honestly can not see why this movie is appreciated so well; the cinematography is not that great and i have seen many more emotionally involving/uplifting movies as well, just think of The great dictator, The celebration (Festen), Leaving Las Vegas, etc.. 7/10\n",

Acting ok, story ok, what am I missing? I know it was nominated for academy awards and maybe (not really) it's earns them. But for the life of me I can't believe this is the #1 movie of all times???? I'm not trying to be an ass truly. But of all time? The direction seems to be adequate the lighting is good all the boxes are ticked-still don't get it. I feel like I could name five better films off the top of my head. Amadeus I think is 10 times the picture over Shawshank. Just to name one. Ok now I'll stop.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption,\" directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, is a profound exploration of hope, friendship, and resilience set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank State Penitentiary. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a long-time inmate and the film's narrator. Their performances are nothing short of extraordinary, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.The narrative unfolds over several decades, chronicling Andy's perseverance and quiet defiance against the oppressive prison system. Despite the grim environment, Andy's indomitable spirit and resourcefulness shine through, symbolized by his relentless pursuit of a seemingly impossible escape plan. His friendship with Red becomes the heart of the film, showcasing a bond forged through mutual respect and shared humanity.Cinematographer Roger Deakins captures the claustrophobic and foreboding atmosphere of the prison with stark, yet beautiful, imagery. The film's pacing allows for a deep emotional connection with the characters, making their triumphs and struggles profoundly impactful. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score further enhances the emotional gravity of the story, creating a perfect synergy with the visual narrative.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not just a story about prison life; it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. It delves into themes of hope, justice, and the redemptive power of friendship, leaving viewers with a lasting sense of inspiration.

      "Content: Is an enduring film about hope, friendship, and resilience, set within the confines of a bleak, oppressive prison. Directed by Frank Darabont and adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film has grown into one of the most celebrated movies of all time, lauded for its profound storytelling, standout performances, and nuanced portrayal of the human spirit.Plot Summary\n",
      "The film follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, as he serves a life sentence at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Inside, he befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a fellow inmate known for his ability to procure contraband. As the years pass, Andy uses his intelligence, integrity, and persistence to affect both the inmates and the institution in subtle yet transformative ways, ultimately finding an unexpected path to freedom.Themes and Tone\n",
      "The Shawshank Redemption explores themes of hope, freedom, friendship, and institutionalization. Despite the despair inherent in prison life, the film is profoundly uplifting. Hope is an integral message, embodied in the stark contrast between Andy, who holds onto his sense of self and purpose, and the institutionalized \"lifers,\" who've been worn down by the system. Red initially dismisses hope as \"a dangerous thing,\" but Andy's quiet resilience plants seeds of change within Red and ultimately redefines what it means to be free.\n",

      "This movie single-handedly proves that you do not need incredible action scenes and hilarious humor to make a great piece of art. This movie is basically just people talking to each other with an occasional intense scene thrown in every so often and it makes it absolutely perfect. The one thing I love more than anything in a film is to see a group of characters change so significantly for the better and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the movie that does so better than any that has been made. Without spoiling anything, The two characters Andy and Red could not seem to be any more different at the beginning and throughout the film we gradually see them grow closer and closer together as different individuals and it grows into such a special bond that nothing could possibly break. Under such terrible circumstances the main character Andy has to endure throughout his time, all we see from him is nothing but hope, a message so strong that it is guaranteed to leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches and truly appreciates this beautiful piece of artwork.\n",

      "Content: This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.\n",

On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.\n",

      "Content: For a long time now I had seen this movie move up the IMDb ladder and make its way to becoming #1, I was a bit irritated being that it took the spot of \"The Godfather\" however, this was before I had ever laid my eyes on even a trailer for this film, so I researched through the credits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my favorite writers \"Stephen King\", I know what your thinking, how could he be one of my favorite writers if I didn't even have a clue about this Masterpiece. July 24, 2010 was my movie day, I promised myself I was going to stay up 24 Hours watching some of my favorite Films, I started of at around 12:45 with the controversial, sadistic, genius, masterpiece that is \"A Clockwork Orange\", then after my brain was through with Ultra-Violence I proceeded watching the best sequel ever made in the History of cinema \"The Godfather Part II\", then after I felt like a Corleone I started watching the Coen Brothers Masterpiece \"No Country For Old Men\", then after feeling lost I started watching \"Pulp Fiction\" and after that the time was around 4:30 P.M. and I broke my promise to myself and took what I thought was going to be a 2 Hour Nap which turned into a 6 Hour Intermission, I woke up around 10:00 deciding which movie I was going to watch and I wanted it to be a Classic I had never seen, I was thinking \"12 Angry Men\" but for some reason I wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to Shawkshank Redemption\" so I rented it and started watching around 11:45 P.M., Let me just say after this movie left an Impact in my Life and Mind, I now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good reason, this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in \"Animal House\", it made me think like \"Fight Club\" does at times, it made me frightened like \"The Shining\" at times and I have no other movie to reference my Sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me Cry, and that should tell you that after a day of Great Films this one had the biggest Impact on me.\n",

      "Content: One of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable masterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the Academy).\"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful films ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen King becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film became unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after seeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and her lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story when he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts between this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to bring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later that Andy discovers that his arrest was all a \"misunderstanding.\"The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing and detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in the place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia of prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog that narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose end, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A story that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time of hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never abandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the performances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being perfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim Robbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it is, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more than that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should be watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally breathtaking classic.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, is often hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. Here's a review of this timeless classic:The film follows the story of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he claims he didn't commit. It explores themes of hope, friendship, institutionalization, and the indomitable human spirit. Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance as Andy Dufresne, capturing his resilience and quiet determination in the face of adversity. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is iconic, providing narration that guides the audience through the story with wisdom and introspection. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is palpable, anchoring the emotional depth of the film. Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, balancing moments of despair with hope and redemption. The film's cinematography, by Roger Deakins, beautifully captures the oppressive atmosphere of Shawshank prison while highlighting moments of freedom and solace. The use of light and shadow underscores the themes of imprisonment and liberation, creating a visually stunning backdrop for the story.\n",

      "Content: \"The true masterpiece\" This movie has a quite way defining the life, struggles, deep happiness and sadness. The director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here.Nothing less than a Divine Gift to the World. Once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) both have best performances. The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene showing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me.It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. A prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid.I would say that this movie is aptly rated. This movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true Hope.\n",

      "Title: Hope is a powerful thing\n",
      "Content: What makes The Shawshank Redemption so timeless is its message: no matter how trapped or isolated one feels, hope can never be fully taken away. The film's ending, which brings Andy's long-anticipated escape and Red's eventual freedom, is one of the most uplifting conclusions in cinema history.The cinematography and production design also contribute significantly to the film's atmosphere. The prison, with its towering walls and stark interiors, feels like a character in itself-cold and imposing, yet containing small pockets of humanity. The score by Thomas Newman is haunting and elevates the emotional impact of key moments.\n",

      "Title: Still one of the best movies. Quality does not age.\n",
      "Content: In \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" Nietzsche's existential themes manifest as Andy Dufresne navigates the harsh prison environment, embodying the will to power by transcending adversity. Freudian undertones emerge as the characters grapple with suppressed desires and the subconscious, paralleling the prison's metaphorical confinement. Jungian archetypes surface in the camaraderie among inmates, forming a collective unconscious that mirrors the human psyche's intricate dynamics.Da Vinci's multifaceted genius echoes in the film's meticulous storytelling and character development. Andy, akin to Da Vinci's Renaissance spirit, employs intellect as a tool for liberation, sculpting hope amidst the penitentiary's gloom. The interplay of these philosophical and psychological elements crafts a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its prison setting, resonating with the essence of human struggle and resilience.\n",

Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.\n",

      "Content: I look at many of the contenders that would be the most marvellous movies ever made and can only be more reassured of this film's true status as the absolute pinnacle of what Hollywood has tried to portray over the past century. This film (as many greats), was originally ignored by critics even shunned.So we should ask what actually makes a good film..., what makes the perfect movie???? Well, the answer in three words is .... 'The Shawshank Redemption'. This film was originally put down because it was not the best filmed or best acted etc., but overall it is better than 'ANYTHING' ever before and the benchmark for all that followed. I can't imagine a movie lover who would dismiss any notion that his or her life was made slightly better by this film (YES REALLY IT IS THAT GOOD).The Godfather films even The lord of the rings are enormous cinematic triumphs, but for me the measure of a film is in how it tells a story, and how it leaves you feeling at the end. I can't imagine any narcotic that could rouse you in the same way as this would should you be viewing for the first time.A simple story of a middle class young man, imprisoned for killing his wife in an unforgiving fortress, left with nothing but his intelligence and his strength of heart. Through his relationships with his inmates, and his ability to survive we walk every step with Andy until we finally witness the genius of ..... \"The Shawshank Redemption\" If you haven't seen this you are so unbelievably lucky to be able to experience it for the first time.The best and most 'need to see' film ever made.11/10\n",

Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex.\n",

Adapted from Stephen King's novella, it is a profound exploration of hope, resilience, and the human spirit.Set within the bleak confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, a man wrongly imprisoned for murder. As he endures the brutalities of prison life, Andy finds solace in an unlikely friendship with Ellis \"Red\" Redding, portrayed by Morgan Freeman. Their deep bond becomes the emotional core of the story, offering a flicker of hope amidst despair.Directed by Frank Darabont, Shawshank skillfully captures the essence of King's narrative, blending emotion, authenticity, and meticulous craftsmanship in every scene. From the oppressive walls of Shawshank to the moments of freedom, the film immerses viewers in Andy's transformative journey, reaffirming the power of the human spirit to prevail against all odds.\n",

The characters, with their quiet defiance and inner strength, serve as mirrors to our own struggles, reminding us that true freedom often begins within the soul.

If it would have been about women instead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that it is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love story. Tim Robbins should be ashamed to have taken part, for his performance was the most wooden I'd seen since Daryl Hannah in (insert any 80s movie she appeared in here). Morgan Freeman was even more dreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since. I don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but \"Children of the Corn\" was insightful in comparison to this dribble.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" did not win \"Best Picture\" because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does NOT need to win some sort of \"award\" top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through.This is not just a movie...It's an experience that everyone need to partake in. I have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE OUT OF ALL WHERE I ACTUALLY FORGET THESE ARE ACTORS ACTING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WITH A MOVIE CREW. Do you know what that means? --It means not only Frank Darabont, but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. THIS IS WHAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE FILM BUSINESS DREAMS ABOUT...MAKING A MOVIE THIS GROUNDBREAKING.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...Even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --Maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation.Sometimes when I talk about this movie to people I feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. I feel like saying \"are you insane?\"\n",

      "Content: At the time of this writing \"The Shawshank Redemption\" occupies the top spot in IMDb's list of top rated films. I will state right off the bat that I don't agree with that assessment but that doesn't mean that I don't think the film is a fine one.The story (based on a Stephen King novella) concerns a man sent to Shawshank Penitentiary after being convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Once there he undergoes many hardships but eventually befriends the resident dealer in contraband and strikes an accord with the guards and warden. However, through it all he never loses the hope that someday, somehow he'll regain his freedom.The cast is commendable. Morgan Freeman delivered the film's best performance and landed a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. Tim Robbins was excellent as well, giving one of the best performances of his career. The remainder of the cast is filled out by an assortment of well-chosen character actors. Of these, Bob Gunton & James Whitmore deserve special praise.The film's production values don't disappoint either though they are undeniably not at quite the same level as the films that critics usually dub the best of all time. Frank Darabont's direction is tasteful, though, and is bolstered by Oscar-nominated cinematography courtesy of eight time nominee Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman's Oscar-nominated score has some memorable moments and provides solid support throughout.In the end, though, while the film is indeed admirable from a technical standpoint, it is the emotional impact that has made it a favorite of so many. Naturally, emotional responses will vary from person to person but this film seems to hit the mark more than any other. Do yourself a favour and check it out.\n",

It's about this guy, Andy Dufresne, who gets sent to prison for something he didn't even do. The whole time, you're just rooting for him because he's so smart and determined, like he never gives up hope, even when things get really bad.Morgan Freeman plays this guy named Red, and he's just perfect. His voice narrates the story, and it's so soothing but also so full of wisdom. The friendship between Andy and Red is just everything. The movie is super emotional, and it totally pulls you in-like, you feel all the highs and lows they go through.The ending is literally everything; it's so satisfying and uplifting. It's not just a prison movie; it's about hope, redemption, and finding freedom in the darkest places. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it ASAP! Trust me, it's worth it.\n",

What makes it truly remarkable is its ability to move you deeply and inspire hope, even if your own life is vastly different from the characters' struggles. You can't help but feel connected to their journey.This film is elegant in its simplicity, yet its message is profoundly enduring. Frank Darabont didn't rely on flashy special effects to win us over-he didn't need to. The stellar narration and brilliant performances speak volumes on their own. It's baffling that this movie didn't win all seven Oscars, but awards aside, its legacy is undeniable. Let its place on IMDb's Top 250 list convince you, or the glowing recommendations from anyone who's seen it.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and watch this film. You'll finally understand why it's celebrated as one of the greatest movies of all time, and why it remains my absolute favorite.\n",

It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.\n",

Or how about Scum or even Chopper.I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like.  As if he has a clue!I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to.  Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.\n",

      "Title: From Despair to Freedom: A Technical and Emotional Look at The Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: As a budding filmmaker, I recently had the profound pleasure of watching The Shawshank Redemption, a cinematic masterpiece that has captivated audiences worldwide and rightfully earned its place among the greatest films ever made. This timeless classic is not just a captivating story of hope, friendship, and redemption; it is also a masterclass in filmmaking, offering invaluable lessons for aspiring filmmakers like myself.A Visual SymphonyFrom the opening shot, The Shawshank Redemption immerses us in a world of stark contrasts, both visually and thematically. The oppressive walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary stand in stark contrast to the lush green fields and the vast expanse of the blue sky that lie just beyond its reach. This visual metaphor perfectly encapsulates the film's central themes of confinement and freedom.The film's color grading is equally masterful, with a palette that is both muted and evocative. The use of cool tones, such as blues and grays, creates a sense of isolation and despair, while the occasional bursts of warm colors, such as yellows and oranges, represent glimmers of hope and possibility.Director Frank Darabont's use of low-key lighting and natural light further enhances the film's atmosphere. The dark, shadowy corners of the prison represent the harsh realities of life behind bars, while the natural light that filters through the prison windows symbolizes the hope that still flickers within the hearts of the inmates.A Story that ResonatesAt its core, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about the human spirit's ability to endure and overcome even the most challenging circumstances. Andy Dufresne, the film's protagonist, is a man who is wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Despite the harsh realities of his new life, Andy never gives up hope. He maintains his dignity, his integrity, and his belief in a better future.Andy's friendship with Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a fellow inmate, is one of the film's most heartwarming and poignant elements. Their bond provides them with both solace and strength, and it serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of places, human connection can offer a lifeline.The film's message of hope is universal and timeless. It is a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we can always find the strength to carry on. It is a testament to the power of the human spirit to triumph over even the most difficult circumstances.A Masterclass in FilmmakingThe Shawshank Redemption is not just a great story; it is also a masterclass in filmmaking. Every element of the film, from the cinematography and editing to the performances and score, comes together seamlessly to create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.The film's cinematography is simply stunning. The use of low-key lighting, natural light, and high and low angles creates a visually arresting and emotionally evocative world. The editing is also masterful, with a slow, deliberate pace that allows the story to unfold naturally and for the characters to develop fully.The performances in The Shawshank Redemption are nothing short of exceptional. Tim Robbins delivers a tour-de-force performance as Andy Dufresne, capturing the character's quiet strength, resilience, and unwavering hope. Morgan Freeman is equally brilliant as Ellis \"Red\" Redding, providing a voice of wisdom and experience throughout the film.The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, is a masterpiece in its own right. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the film's emotional tone, and they linger in the viewer's mind long after the credits roll.A Film that Will Stay with You Long After the Credits RollThe Shawshank Redemption is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is a story that will move you, inspire you, and remind you of the power of hope and the resilience of the human spirit. #thisisadamgabriel As a budding filmmaker, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have experienced this cinematic masterpiece. It has taught me invaluable lessons about storytelling, filmmaking, and the power of cinema to touch our hearts and minds.\n",

I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far.\n",

Their unlikely friendship becomes a beacon of light in the darkness, offering solace and a glimmer of hope. Andy's unwavering optimism challenges the cynicism that festers within the prison walls, inspiring those around him to find their own strength.More Than Just a Prison BreakThe Shawshank Redemption isn't just about a daring escape. It's a testament to the human spirit's ability to find hope even in the bleakest circumstances. The film is masterfully crafted, with superb performances from Freeman and Robbins.

      "Content: Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'.This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America.A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the inmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry 'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul.\n",

      "Content: I'll save everyone from having to read the same list of superlatives that are in 99% of these comments, and just agree that it is literally the best movie ever made.My comments will be about my theory that Andy Dufresne was intentionally developed as a Christ figure in the movie.  I never actually read the short story, so I don't know if that was Stephen King's intention, but I do believe that that is what the film-makers had in mind.  Andy Dufrense (initials A.D.) gave many speeches that sounded like sermons.  He spoke of never losing faith, no matter how bad it was in prison.  He wanted his friends to believe there was a better place waiting for them (Mexico).  He performed miracles providing them with beverages on the rooftop.  By the end the warden saw Andy as a threat to his power if nothing else through sheer charisma.  Andy escaped the prison and contacted his friends still in prison through a letter, giving them all hope.  When he escaped, he raised his arms into a definite crucifix-like position (in the rain storm).Maybe I'm just stating the obvious (I mean \"Redemption\" is in the title!), or maybe I'm completely off base, but I am suprised I haven't seen this movie discussed in a more religious way (other than having such a religious following).  I'm not really a church-goer for my own reasons, but I found watching this movie to be a wholly spiritual experience.  I don't know what my favorite movie is, but whatever it is, it's no Shawshank...\n",

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption has been the number 1 ranked movie on IMDB for some years. What does that tell you?Maybe it's mainly male readership values an all men movie. Where the only woman of consequence cheated on her husband and got murdered!A rising young banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has been jailed for life for killing his wife and her lover. When he enters Shawshank State Penitentiary. One of the prisoners Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) thinks that Andy will struggle to survive the first night.Instead another new inmate wails like a baby and is brutally beaten up by guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown.) He later dies in the prison hospital, the other prisoners did not even catch his name.The ever quiet Andy befriends Red asking him to procure a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth.Andy realises that the Bible loving prison warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a greedy hypocrite.Over time, Andy comes into invaluable use to the warden and the guards because of his knowledge of the tax system. He files their tax returns and launders their money.In return he is saved from the prison rapists. Andy becomes popular with the other inmates, most touching is his friendship with Red that endures for 20 years.When I first watched The Shawshank Redemption, I regarded it as a well made prison movie. Poetical courtesy of Morgan Freeman's narration. Writer and director Frank Darabont had elevated Stephen King's source novella.I revisited many years later, in case I did the movie an injustice. I can why the movie is held in high regard. It has good performances from Robbins and Freeman, although Robbins is a bit too subdued.Maybe that is because events show that Andy was always a man with an escape plan the moment he stepped inside the prison.The movie also has something to say about prison culture. Many of these men have become institutionalised. It makes barbed observations about the parle board and how cheap prison labour affects the local economy.Is it the greatest film of all time? Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Gone with the Wind suggests that it is a no.It is not even the best movie from 1994 not to win the Best Picture Oscar. That accolade goes to Pulp Fiction.\n",

Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the indomitable human spirit.Set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the life of Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder. As the story unfolds, we witness Andy's resilience and unwavering hope, which not only transforms his own life but touches the hearts of those around him.Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis \"Red\" Redding is nothing short of iconic. His narration provides a rich and insightful perspective, serving as the soul of the film. Freeman's performance is both poignant and deeply moving, capturing the essence of a man who finds redemption in the most unexpected of places.The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances, each character contributing to the tapestry of the prison's microcosm. Bob Gunton as the ruthless Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley bring an intimidating presence that contrasts starkly with the hope Andy embodies.\n",

      "Title: It is the #2 film of all time but is it any good? No!!\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named \"Red\"( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole \"big\" finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade.2/10\n",

It has a typical happy ending. It has the kind of wrap up reminiscent of a romantic comedy. It doesn't seem very authentic, men in prison are miserable or unrelatable. The main characters truly come off as insane. No movie starring Morgan Freeman was every truly a great piece. He tries too hard to be profound, and it makes him look like a dumb smug ass. I don't have anything against him though. But he'll never be Denzel Washington. He's like bad luck. Maybe it's based on a book that was much better, haha!\n",

      "Content: I'm way too astonished to find THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at the top of the rankings list. Maybe it's because TITANIC got your tongues!This is a very satisfying tale about prison life that develops friendships and painful moments, with solid performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's disturbing to mention a couple of major flaws I've noticed in spending 2-1/2 hours of silver screen magic. Lengthy time is just one of them. Another is that certain scenes quickly lose your interest, while others are so interesting that you can't help but sit back and enjoy them with the pleasure of comfort. Just draw a line graph inside your head and notice how the levels get screwed as time progresses. Same thing with those machines that measure waves of earthquake intensities. I'm not being too complex, but I think this is a good comparison to what the movie accomplished in general. So much for the harsh part...With good intentions, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION gets better and better at the conclusion, which is by far the most impressive I've witnessed. We must think of this film, as a whole, a true part of escaping society's problems, the definite basis of what it really means. Freeman's narration contributes to the story with thought, and Robbins does exceptionally well as a con who awaits the splendor of freedom. Stephen King did an adequate enough job in writing a book that escapes horror. Prison flicks usually are straightforward, but there is higher emphasis on its ideal writing, a crucially vital element in good filmmaking standards.So while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has some pros and cons, it is a natural and redeeming look at the pains and friendships that any living soul can accept or caress. It isn't THE greatest movie ever filmed, but stands out as a Hollywood classic that will see future years for the whole world to crave.Then again, I did not say TITANIC \"is\" the greatest...\n",

The mere fact that TBS plays this movie sixteen times per week, thereby forcing you to watch it over and over again, does not mean that it is good. I therefore, call for a \"surge\" of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so that with the help of Mark Twain and his angels we will be able to oust it from its ill-deserved spot as IMDb #1 movie of all time. Honestly, my fellow Americans, this film is the kind of thing that makes us look bad.Merry Christmas, and to all a good night.\n",

      "Content: Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" stands as a timeless testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Since its release in 1994, this film has garnered a dedicated following and critical acclaim, securing its place as one of the greatest movies ever.Plot and ThemesSet in the oppressive confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the story follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Andy's stoic demeanour and quiet determination intrigue his fellow inmates, particularly Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned lifer who narrates the story. Over two decades, Andy and Red form an enduring friendship that becomes a beacon of hope amidst the bleakness of prison life.The movie masterfully explores themes of hope, freedom, and redemption. Despite overwhelming odds, Andy's relentless pursuit of justice and personal redemption resonates deeply with audiences. His efforts to improve the prison library and his audacious plan to escape serve as metaphors for the indomitable human spirit.PerformancesTim Robbins delivers a nuanced performance as Andy Dufresne, embodying a powerful, vulnerable character. Robbins' portrayal captures Andy's quiet dignity and unyielding hope, moving his journey profoundly.Morgan Freeman, as Red, provides the film's emotional anchor. His portrayal is warm and reflective, with his rich, soothing voice adding depth to the narration. Freeman's ability to convey Red's transformation from a man resigned to his fate to one who dares to dream again is remarkable.Direction and CinematographyFrank Darabont's direction is both subtle and powerful. It allows the story to unfold at a measured pace that mirrors the slow passage of time within the prison walls. Darabont's focus on character development over spectacle ensures the emotional beats hit hard, creating a deeply immersive experience.Roger Deakins's cinematography is another standout element. Deakins uses light and shadow to great effect, contrasting the dark, oppressive prison interiors with moments of light and hope. The use of wide shots to capture the scale and monotony of prison life, juxtaposed with intimate close-ups that reveal the characters' inner turmoil, is masterfully done.ScoreThomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the film perfectly. The music underscores the narrative's emotional highs and lows, enhancing the overall impact. The recurring motifs and subtle orchestration add layers of meaning to critical scenes, making the score an integral part of the storytelling.Impact and LegacyDespite a modest box office performance upon its release, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has become a cultural touchstone. Its themes of hope and perseverance continue to resonate, and its reputation has only grown with time. Its enduring popularity is evident in its consistent presence in various \"greatest films\" lists.Conclusion\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a profoundly moving cinematic experience that captures the essence of human resilience. Through stellar performances, masterful direction, and a poignant narrative, it offers a powerful message of hope and redemption. It is a film that stands the test of time and inspires each new generation of viewers. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the twentieth, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" remains a deeply affecting and unforgettable film.\n",

Though I do not want to belittle those who worship \"Shawshank,\" I would suggest that anyone who has seen it should rent \"Escape From Alcatraz.\" Then you may think twice before calling \"Shawshank\" the greatest film ever.\n",

      "Content: What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.\n",

      "Content: I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.\n",

      "Content: I just finished watching \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" and I am absolutely speechless. This movie isn't just something you watch-it's something you feel deep within your soul. It's rare to come across a film that makes you reflect on life, hope, and the resilience of the human spirit the way this one does.From the first frame to the last, I was captivated, not just by the story, but by the emotions it stirred within me. I found myself rooting for Andy, feeling his pain, his hope, and ultimately, his triumph. The way the film captures the essence of hope is nothing short of extraordinary. It left me with a sense of awe, a renewed belief in the power of perseverance, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.This isn't just a movie-it's a masterpiece that has profoundly impacted me. I can say without hesitation that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the best film I have ever seen. It's one of those rare experiences that you carry with you long after it's over, and it has left an indelible mark on my heart.\n",

      "Content: Easily the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen it a lot.However there is not much that can be said about the film that has not already been said. Even though I have seen it more than 100 times and once saw it 4 times in one day the best thing I can leave you with is simply this:Some extremely good movies are not only famous for there stories and acting but also their soundtracks. Inception would be a great example of this. Shawshank however is so extremely brilliant and captivating that you barely realise that the soundtrack itself is one of the best ever made. Seriously have a listen to the soundtrack on spotify and rewatch the movie. For me it elevated the movie to new heights, which should not have been possible.\n",

      "Content: I first watched this movie for a class in school when I was supposed to read the book but I didn't so at every twist and turn I had to pretend like this movie wasn't effecting me cause I was supposed to know the plot but I obviously didn't. Now I've been able to finally rewatch it on my own and I was terrified it wasn't gonna hold up but it did if not just get even better. This movie is able to hit all the different emotional beats and stay Interesting through out the whole thing and make every minute of its run time worth it. It's just such a cathartic movie everything plays out not as you expect it but as it should play out which is great. I also love how every plot beat is important not only to the on going plot itself but also the themes and messaging of the movie which I'll get to. Like by the end of the movie everything just comes back together and it's so great. The themes of the movie are also amazing not only does it have the simple method of hope which is already great but also it shows the horrible state of the prison system where institutionalization is worked in to the person over rehabilitation where it's impossible to live outside of prison once you go in due to a multitude of reasons it just supports people to go back in. Not only that but the state of the inside with corruptible cops & leniency on horrible prisoners like the sisters and other things like that just being accepted it's just a completely different world that shapes its people differently and I feel that's an important message. This movie is timeless and as much as I feel like a sheep giving it a 10 there's not reason to try and deny it just cause others agree when it's true it's true.\n",

      "Content: im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.\n",

      "Content: Few things you probably already know about 'The Shawshank Redemption': it was nominated for 7 Oscars, yet failed to win any, it failed at the box office and it is one of the best movie ever made.I felt mesmerized watching this movie, and I believe everyone who has watched it must have felt the same. A perfect adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', this movie stays faithful to the plot of the novella with very minor alterations. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have given stellar performances. Freeman's eloquent narration throughout the film provides the description of the events happening over the prison and his friendship with Andy Dufresne over a number of years from his character's perspective.The main themes of the movie, hope, self-worth, integrity and friendship are beautifully interlocked with the prison-drama. The climate of Shawshank State Penitentiary is painted gray and dull to amplify the intensity of every event. The depiction of institutionalized life and emotions of the prisoners, who aren't only trapped inside Shawshank physically but psychologically as well, are very precise. The character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, displays extraordinary courage and self-worth in the hopeless walls of Shawshank prison. The climax is intricately woven with poetic justice.This film is Frank Darabont's Magnum Opus. A well deserved #1 on IMDb's Top 250.\n",

The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.\n",

As Red famously says, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" This sentiment reverberates throughout the narrative, culminating in one of the most satisfying and uplifting endings in cinematic history. Though it underperformed at the box office upon its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption has since earned its rightful place as a cultural touchstone. Its universal appeal lies in its authenticity-every moment feels earned, every emotion raw and real. Whether you're drawn to its rich storytelling, brilliant performances, or profound messages, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that lingers long after the credits roll. It reminds us that even in the face of insurmountable odds, hope can be our greatest strength.\n",

      "Content: The movie actor Andy was thrown into the prison by no good reasons. During his stay in the prison he managed to improve the situation in that prison for the prisoners. Finally he escaped the restrictions of the hell-like prison through a tunnel he dug himself little by little, day by day.There was something different on Andy. He seemed not one among the prisoners but the one in another world as Red narrated. He did not want to act in collusion with others; instead, he did everything in his own way. He never gave up hoping that one day miracle would occur. While doing the day-by-day work, he was occupied in digging a tunnel quietly, secretly and planningly so as to escape from the terrible life in the prison at the right moment. He did succeed.In my eyes, Andy is really a big hero, a second Mounte Crisco. He deserved the life that he¡¯d been dreaming of . Even now I still remember the conversation made between Andy and his good friend, Red, a black person. They were talking about Hope. Red said ¡°Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place he better gets used to the idea.¡± But Andy did not agree with him. He considered that ¡°That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.¡± At the moment, Andy¡¯s words were deeply imprinted on my mind and I was suddenly lost in deep meditation¡­Hope? What is Hope? Hope is as Andy said. Hope is something that holds you stand and push towards. Hope is slight light in the darkness. Even though it is meager, it can lead you to brightness and to a colorful world that you dream of. Hope is in your heart .Only if you keep a new morrow¡¯s sun, black clouds can not confine its glory into their own world. Where there is hope, there is sunshine .Where is sunshine, there is life. Hold your hope tight and hold your life.\n",

      "Content: This film is brilliant, just brilliant. I watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended I knew it would stay with me forever. Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies, the 70's had The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the 80's had Platoon and Raging Bull the 90's had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the 2000's had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of good films in the 90's and this is up there with the best . The story is about a man called Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly convicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible and Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the script is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King and Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have been good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition (Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple.So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be blown away.\n",

      "Content: Shawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A film is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against insurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect film is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human being for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are so gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so involved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable. I loved this film!\n",

      "Content: I've been thinking why is this movie The best movie for so many people, then I remembered it is like music, the best music is the ones you heard at 14. because you associate with memory and when your brain starts developing and your awareness of yourself and others come into being.this movie revitalized my love for classical and baroque music no doubt and introduced some themes. I find the main character somewhat unrealistic only because I personally cannot relate to him. If I was in his position I doubt I would have done what he did.It is good but I prefer Morgan Freeman's The Bucket List much more and a variety of prison movies(American History X) and TV series(Prison Break).\n",

      "Title: Hope Springs Eternal\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its prison setting to explore themes of hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit.The story centres on Andy Dufresne, a stoic and intelligent banker, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison, Andy's quiet determination and ingenuity set him apart from the other inmates. Through his unwavering sense of hope, he befriends Ellis \"Red\" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman in a career-defining role. Freeman's soulful narration lends the film a contemplative tone, drawing viewers into the heart of the story.The relationship between Andy and Red forms the emotional core of the film. Their bond evolves over decades, showcasing the power of human connection, even in the bleakest circumstances. Robbins conveys Andy's subtle strength and inner torment with understated grace, while Freeman's portrayal of Red is layered with wisdom, regret, and quiet humour, making both characters feel deeply human and relatable.Darabont's direction is impeccable, capturing both the oppressive monotony of prison life and the profound moments of humanity that shine through it. Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously composed to highlight the contrasts between confinement and freedom. Thomas Newman's haunting score complements the film perfectly, its delicate piano melodies lingering in the mind long after the credits roll.The narrative unfolds as a slow burn, allowing the characters and their struggles to fully resonate. Moments of levity, such as Andy's triumphant broadcast of an opera duet over the prison's PA system, provide glimmers of beauty in an otherwise harsh world. The film builds to a deeply satisfying and cathartic conclusion, where justice and redemption finally prevail, making it all the more emotionally rewarding.While The Shawshank Redemption is ultimately a story of hope, it does not shy away from the darker realities of prison life, including corruption, violence, and despair. These elements ground the film in a harsh reality, making Andy's triumph all the more poignant and significant.In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-watch for anyone who values storytelling at its finest. With powerful performances, masterful direction, and universal themes of perseverance and redemption, the film stands as a timeless testament to the indomitable nature of the human spirit. It is not just a film, but an experience that stays with you long after viewing, cementing its place as a classic.\n",

      "Title: Scheme Of Hope\n",
      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that \"salvation lies within.\" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.\"Hope can drive a man insane,\" Red warns Andy. \"It's got no use on the inside.\" Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, \"Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,\" it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film \"Harvey\" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it for you\" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (\"fresh fish\") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.\"Shawshank\" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that \"a warm place without memory\" is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here. Andy wants out of \"Shawshank\" bad, but for viewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in.\n",

      "Title: Its position in IMDb top5 is not wrong !\n",
      "Content: One of the finest films ever made, this movie is a sheer work of art. It's a poignant story of hope. That's what makes this film much more than just a movie. It tells a lesson about life. It's a narrative about freedom, friendship and patience. The Plot is average, but the story-telling, acting and cinematography are the reasons that make the movie, memorable. The director Frank Darabont has been flawless with his work. The story is about Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbings through the eyes of Red (played by Morgan Freeman, in his best role ever). Andy is wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Although nothing much happens in the way of plot for 2hours, in a movie having a playing time of 2hrs 22minutes, you would never get bored. I won't give any spoilers, in case you haven't seen it yet. Just go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. There is no way, it is highly overrated. Its topmost position in IMDb ratings is the evidence. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\"All men die, not every man truly lives.\"\n",

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is entertaining and well made. It's not, however, the greatest movie of all time. It's a thoughtful film and is remarkable for appealing to people who don't usually put a whole lot of thinking into their cinema. It covers the greatest range of viewers for like-ability from the Fast and the Furious crowd to the Lost in Translation audience. I don't think it'd attract big numbers from the cinema nerds of Eraserhead fandom though. That's not to say that Lynch fans should have a more weighted vote on IMDb. It's just that if you're into your cinema and you watch a lot of good films, from obscure to popular, then being told Shawshank Redemption is the best film of all time is like hearing someone say Radiohead is the best band ever. Yes, they're very good but you suspect their cheerleaders are only comparing them to Coldplay, U2 and REM.\n",

      "Title: Hope springs eternal\n",
      "Content: \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.\" Sixteen words. Eighteen syllables. Endless emotions.The work began as short story fiction which first appeared in a collection of four novellas by authorStephen King. DIFFERENT SEASONS - which contains the original RITA HAYWORTH AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and gave rise to three film adaptations from the pages within, (the stellarStań przy mnie (1986), the limpUczeń szatana (1998)and this film) - marked the starting line for this race,Skazani na Shawshank (1994)- starringTim RobbinsandMorgan Freemanin each actor's finest roles - marks the finish line. But the race against time and tide that occurs across both formats has absolutely nothing to do with what the casual observer might suspect. Contrary to what you might think, this tale has much less to do with a wrongly imprisoned man who manages a stunning and bold escape than it does with one simple ideal: Hope. The story compels both the reader and the filmgoer to never give up on hope.Bettering the original text by miles,Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece captures and conveys the struggle, despair and - ultimately - the hope that exist at odds with each other in the life of wrongly convicted and (at first appearance) defeated Andy Dufresne. The cuckolded Dufresne (pronounced Doo Frane - I mention this simply because when I first read the novella in high school, I could not for the life of me figure out how to pronounce the guy's name! - and played with a weariness and determination second to none by Robbins in all of his postBull Durham (1988)glory) is arrested, charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the cold blooded, heat-of-the-moment murder of his wife and her illicit secret lover. All of this occurs within the first few minutes of the film, and following Dufresne's arrival at the upstate Maine, maximum security prison, we are off to the races. What follows is a series of tests for the battle worn Dufresne; each subsequent hardship more brutal and vicious than the previous. Yet all the while Dufresne holds onto the notion that hope will endure. You see, Andy is an innocent man. Don't believe him? Neither does anyone else within the prison. Not even his newest \"friend\", Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). But Andy holds on. And in time... prevails.Borrowing heavily from King's actual text, Darabont - who also penned the screenplay - moves the story into a tighter space. Excising some of the characters (the numerous Prison Wardens of the novella have been spliced into one raging beast of a man, expertly played byBob Gunton) and streamlining the narrative provide Darabont the means to bury the idea of fading but eternal hope straight into the heart of the viewer. The basic premise is still present... in fact much of King's actual dialogue is used throughout the film. But Darabont makes just enough changes to push the story in a more open and raw direction. (The character of Red, for example, is a hard living, red-haired Irishmen in the original story; Darabont cast Freeman and turned the friendship between the two main characters on its head.)I could go into greater explanation about how this film has affected me in a very deep and graphic way. I could explain how the scene in which Andy, drenched in the new rain of freedom, arms outstretched to the heavens and standing alone as a free man for the very first time, sends chills down my spine every time I even envision it in my mind. I could explain how the scene in which Red feels the need to beg for a bathroom break from his new \"Boss\" at the grocery store causes me to feel so sad for the lost soul that Red has become. I could explain how the sad post script messages left by not only Brooks but by Red himself dug into the boarding house rafters bring on an insurmountable grief the likes of which I cannot define. I could explain how the final pilgrimage undertaken by Red as he skips town and streaks southward on a Greyhound bus, reciting King's exact words along the way - \"I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope to see my friend... I hope to shake his hand... I hope.\" - bring a flood of tears and goose bumps forward in my psyche. I could explain how witnessing Andy and Red's final reunion on a sandy Mexico beach reminds me of the hope I hold onto that I too will have a similar reunion with my long deceased mother in heaven. I could but I won't. And I won't detail more elements of the film as many here have already done so. Besides, has anyone reading this not seen this film? I doubt it. What I would like to do, however, is to have the reader consider a different take on why this film is so moving and so important in the lexicon of Hollywood.This film is by far one of the greatest films to come out of the 1990's... a time when America was at war in Iraq - the first time around - and the stability of our hopes and dreams were in doubt. Sure that conflict ended quickly. But at the time, for many members of Generation X, (myself included) an all out Holy War seemed imminent. Having survived the Cold War and the notion of immediate nuclear annihilation, (anyone remember the made for television movieNazajutrz (1983)?) we were once again thrown back on our heels at the thought of further destruction. Our hope was fading. Perhaps Darabont sensed this when he optioned the rights to King's novella, originally published in 1982. Or perhaps there were other more divine sources at work. Who knows. Maybe it just took that long to get the script up on its feet. But whether it was Darabont, the Gods or just the ever present weight of time... this film came along right when we needed it to. King's tale of hope is felt so deeply throughout the film. This eternal idea that hope never dies. Trapped by time and circumstances beyond his control, Andy chips away at a future free from the confines of cinder and steel. So too did the rest of us. We just didn't know it at the time. Andy's struggle mirrored our own. The film provided a glimpse toward hope.Fast forward to 2001. Steel came crashing down and fires surged on and under the ground in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Can you imagine a better time for the renewal of hope than September of 2001. And again, along cameSkazani na Shawshank (1994). In 2004, the Tenth Anniversary Edition DVD dropped into our laps as a subtle reminder that hope springs eternal. Sure, it came three years after 9/11. But it also came along at a time when our hearts were beginning to heal and our minds were beginning to open. And there it was once again, reminding us that good things never die.It is for this reason that I believe thatSkazani na Shawshank (1994)is one of the greatest films of all time. Showing us the path in 1994, and providing us a gentle reminder in 2004. I am curious to see what 2034 will bring. Curious and cautious at the same time. But I know one thing that will be there regardless: Hope. Because, as Andy himself writes in his last letter to his dear friend Red: \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies. I hope this letter finds you... and finds you well.\"It is a credo that I live by and live for. Hope. And in a very real sense, every time I watch this film, hope springs eternal.\n",

      "Title: Stephen King ain't just a horror novelist\n",
      "Content: From the same book that brought us Stand By Me and Apt Pupil comes The Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't read this book (Different Seasons), you'd better go buy it. And if you haven't seen Apt Pupil (very underrated movie) go rent it.A couple things about this movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best out there. When I read the novella, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' I had never thought that Red was a black man. Maybe he wasn't which just goes to show what a great story and movie this was. IT DIDN'T and IT DOESN'T MATTER that he's black or not. The other thing was that I kind of wish I HADN'T read the story first. Knowing how it was going to end spoiled it a little, not too much because the girl I saw it with was 100% totally surprised when the hole in the wall was discovered. So at least I had that prior knowledge over her. haha!Even though I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 here at IMDb, I'm surprised it's doing battle with The Godfather and Schindler's List for the #1 position here.\n",

      "Content: Before you write this review off, please know that rating it a 4 does not mean I hate this film.My rating system may be a bit different than others. If a movie exists, I want to immediately give it a 5. A 5 seems very middle-of-the-road for me, and I want to give each film the benefit of the doubt. So, I automatically go into a film thinking it's a 5, and if it goes well or gets better as I watch it, that rating goes up. The rating goes down if I see more negative than positive aspects about the film.I explain my rating process to ensure to others that I do NOT hate this film. I thought it was okay - nothing special - but far from a disaster, and yet, further from a masterpiece.As this review is intended to be more advice for first-time viewers, let me get right to the crux of my view on the film: The Shawshank Redemption gets a lot of hype. It has been the pinnacle of many Top 10 lists since its release, and even IMDb here has it at the top of its Top 250. So, unless you have lived most of your life under a rock, you are fully aware of the attention and praise this film has gathered since 1994. Do not - I repeat, do NOT - go into the film expecting great things. If you can watch the movie without any preconceived opinions, that would be the best. You might thoroughly enjoy Shawshank. Going down the checklist, the movie has just about everything you need for a great film:Theme: It's got \"redemption\" in the title, everyone. I think you can figure it out, but the film also touches on forgiveness, endurance, and friendship - all good themes to explore in filmActing: Morgan Freeman is amazing, as always. Tim Robbins is loved by critics (I've never particularly cared for him), and does a decent job of conveying a full spectrum of emotionsSource Material: It's based on a Stephen King short story. Stephen King has been cinema gold, as far as I can tell. The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Green Mile have all been successful It all sounds so good, right? Well, I would definitely tell you to watch this film, as I think most films should be given a chance, especially modern classics such as this one. However, I would not believe all the hype.For me, it was an average film with major expectations, and ultimately, I was let down. I can't say that watching this movie was anything like being in prison, but I could actually connect emotionally with Andy by the end of the film.\n",

      "Content: Whenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and didn't even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which can't be missed.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a cinematic gem that transcends time and genre, leaving an indelible mark on the world of film. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 classic is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and the enduring power of hope.Set within the bleak walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit. His transformation from a quiet and introverted banker into a resilient and intelligent inmate is nothing short of captivating. The heart of the story lies in the profound friendship he forges with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding, portrayed with unparalleled depth by Morgan Freeman. Freeman's narration, as Red, adds a layer of gravitas to the film, making it impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.At its core, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure, to find purpose even in the most dire circumstances, and to maintain hope when all seems lost. The film beautifully explores themes of friendship, redemption, and the quest for freedom, all against the backdrop of a stark and unforgiving prison environment.The supporting cast is nothing short of exceptional, with standout performances from Bob Gunton as the ruthless Warden Norton and William Sadler as the tragic Heywood. The script, penned by Darabont himself, is a masterpiece of dialogue, seamlessly blending moments of humor with profound wisdom.Visually, Roger Deakins' cinematography captures the essence of both confinement and liberation. The iconic scene of Andy's escape through a sewage pipe during a thunderstorm remains etched in cinematic history, a symbol of rebirth and the triumph of the human spirit.Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the narrative, stirring emotions and adding depth to the characters' journeys. The soundtrack, featuring classics like \"Duettino - Sull'aria\" from Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" further enhances the film's emotional impact.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic that invites repeated viewings, as its layers of nuance and symbolism reveal themselves with each watch. It is a film that can make you laugh, cry, and reflect on the human condition, all in the span of 142 minutes.In conclusion, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not just a movie; it is an experience. Its enduring popularity and critical acclaim are a testament to its exceptional storytelling, powerful performances, and profound themes. This film has earned its place among the greatest in cinematic history and remains a must-see for audiences of all generations. Don't miss the opportunity to witness this masterpiece unfold on screen-it's an experience you won't soon forget.\n",

The story has one of the best story lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis Boyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank Redemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think hows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie somewhat reminds me of another great movie \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat nuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses for their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly enjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see this movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have.\n",

      "Title: \"Why The Shawshank Redemption Remains a Cinematic Masterpiece\"\n",
      "Content: *The Shawshank Redemption*, written and directed by Frank Darabont, is a cinematic adaptation of Stephen King's novella *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption*. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a seasoned inmate who becomes Andy's closest friend. Set within the grim walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the story unfolds as Andy navigates the harsh realities of prison life, finding solace in his bond with Red and using his financial expertise to gain favor with the prison's corrupt warden. However, the arrival of a new inmate sets off a chain of events that will change everything.Upon its release in 1994, *The Shawshank Redemption* was met with little fanfare. Its ambiguous title and Columbia Pictures' uncertainty about how to market it led to a disappointing box office performance. Yet, when the Academy Awards rolled around, the film earned several nominations, sparking renewed interest. Though it didn't win any Oscars, its recognition paved the way for its eventual success on home video. Over time, the film grew into a cultural phenomenon, achieving near-mythical status as a modern classic. Its enduring appeal has delighted fans and puzzled critics in equal measure. Regardless of where one stands on the film, its legacy is undeniable, continuing to captivate new audiences and cementing its place in cinematic history.Detractors often criticize the film for its simplicity, implausible plot, and sentimental tone, arguing that it romanticizes prison life. Yet, these critiques overlook the depth of its characters and the emotional resonance of their journeys. At its core, *The Shawshank Redemption* is a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit. While the film does have moments of sentimentality, they serve as a counterbalance to the suffering, degradation, and soul-crushing despair experienced by its characters. The performances of Robbins and Freeman are nothing short of extraordinary, with Robbins delivering a career-best portrayal of Andy's quiet strength and Freeman embodying Red's wisdom and vulnerability with effortless grace.The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Bob Gunton is chillingly smug as Warden Norton, James Whitmore delivers a heartbreaking performance as the elderly \"Birdman of Shawshank,\" and Clancy Brown is menacing as the brutal Capt. Byron Hadley. William Sadler and Mark Rolston add depth to the ensemble, with Sadler providing moments of levity as Heywood and Rolston embodying the vile nature of Bogs Diamond. Behind the camera, Roger Deakins' cinematography is a visual triumph, capturing the stark beauty and oppressive atmosphere of the prison. Thomas Newman's score, with its haunting piano melodies, perfectly complements the film's emotional beats, while the carefully curated soundtrack-ranging from Hank Williams to Mozart's *Le Nozze di Figaro*-adds layers of meaning to the narrative.For those who love *The Shawshank Redemption*, it's a film that stays with you forever. Each viewing evokes a whirlwind of emotions-anger at the injustices, sadness for the characters' struggles, and inspiration from their unyielding hope. Above all, the film reminds us of the power of hope, not just within the confines of its story but as a universal truth. It's a testament to the enduring human spirit and a belief in the possibility of redemption, even in the darkest of places. *The Shawshank Redemption* isn't just a movie; it's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on the soul. **10/10.**\n",

      "Title: No good thing ever dies.\n",
      "Content: The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom – its source is within, and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become 'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if understood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished, one must have something essential and substantial to believe in – call it hope or faith or self esteem – in order to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time, the idea of death itself is the motivating force – a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself – this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph Heller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much abused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in this case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a 'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated 'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by background as well as race, but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy living' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes – a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" remains a timeless masterpiece in cinematic history, offering a profound narrative of hope, friendship, and resilience. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, the film has solidified its place as one of the greatest movies ever made.Tim Robbins delivers a career-defining performance as Andy Dufresne. His portrayal is subtle yet powerful, capturing the essence of a man who remains unbroken despite unimaginable adversity. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is equally compelling, embodying wisdom, warmth, and a deep-seated belief in the possibility of redemption. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is one of the film's core strengths, bringing authenticity and emotional depth to their characters' journey.\n",

      "Content: I love this movie. It truly is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. A timeless classic. It gets the full 10 from me. It sends us numerous messages and has hidden meanings. Its so beautifully laid out and filmed. It teaches us a lot about ex convicts also. Yes, they may have did wrong to go to prison but some can't handle the outside world the way they used to. It has all the emotions embedded in it. Funny, sad, happy, deep all of those emotions and more. I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody I meet. Its beautifully shot to capture the essences of every character and their feelings and emotions. The writing is spectacular. As a writer myself I like to look at the writing and acting. I'm also an actress so those are the two qualities I focus on. The story line is extremely important. If it doesn't make sense then it ruins the movie completely. The acting in this was sensational. The storyline was genius. Definitely worth the full 10 out of 10 rating that I am giving it.\n",

      "Content: Off the hop, I don't mean to upset people with a 9 out of 10 rating. In my world, nobody gets a 10; there is always room for improvement. Mind you, this movie comes very very close to a 10.I knew nothing of the movie before watching it and was picking my jaw up off the floor upon completion. The amount of situations and experiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The simplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction and misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people can portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together like yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.Since, I have seen this movie several times. Each time, I still find something new to ponder if it was intentionally placed, or just happens to fit.I highly recommend this movie to believe in the power of the human spirit and magnitude of motivation brought on by friends.\n",

Now has past one year since I last saw her, so it got me thinking; what is so good about this film? is'it the story? the director? the actors? or maybe just all of this things?. I mean what makes this the best movie ever made?? Is'it the feel-good feeling in the end? I don't know a person whose does't feel good after this movie. Tim's and Morgans's performances both deserved Oscar, but I'm not gonna take'it from Tom Hank's that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if anyone can tell me the ONE thing that make's this the best movie ever made.\n",

Emotionally charged Well acted Well written Well directed Great score Keeps you engaged throughout You fall in love with the characters. Morgan freeman is phenomenal. It makes you realize how important and precious life is. It also teaches how power can be corrupt. The friendships forged in the story are very well crafted by the actors And through plot development. While the main focus revolves around Andy's character played by Tim Tobbins, you are easily affected by the side stories of those that become part of his world. All in all it is an ultimate feel good movie...an ultimate rise of the spirit in the face of tragedy and life dealing you a bad hand of cards. One of my top 5 movies of all time!\n",

      "Title: Best movie ever\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script.Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love \"The Shawshank Redemption\" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.\n",

The sphere that is created in The Shawshank Redemption is meek whereas the sphere that is created in Escape from Alcatraz is thrilling and you can really feel the tension in the prison. The closed ending of this movie is for people, like Frank Darabont, that have little fantasy. The sublime open ending in Escape from Alcatraz leaves room for the viewer to fantasize on what happened to the prisoners.\n",

      "Title: Is The Shawshank Redemption worth watching?\n",
      "Content: Widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, The Shawshank Redemption could make the list for that reason alone. But it's also worth a re-run to truly appreciate all the cinematic details of the film without becoming preoccupied with the plot and Morgan Freeman's luxurious voice (just us?). Oh, and there's also those Stephen King Easter Eggs. The author (who is said to have never cashed in his cheque for the movie) also penned the classics The Shining and Stand By Me and there are subtle nods to both in the film.Way before twisty Oscar-bait dramas (paging Gone Girl) and TV gems like Line of Duty, Daphne du Maurier was the queen of writing sketchy characters. Her mysterious 1951 novel 'My Cousin Rachel' was turned into a film back in 1952 and was nominated for four Academy Awards the following year. However, it's the more recent cinema adaptation starring Rachel Weisz that's been lauded as a truer interpretation of the novel, and it's Weisz's brilliantly elusive acting that makes it a 'must watch twice' kind of movie.\n",

The pressures in a prison are a great deal more concerning than a day to day grunge and nose to the grind stone. Timothy Robbins does amazing in his role in this Movie and the support of friend made of Morgan Freemans character, solid. It really had me pulled in from beginning to end. getting more review lines in can give me an opportunity to be chatty, sure. But sometimes a movie is just a must see. The less you say. The simplistic thought of conveying there is always something more found the second time around. There's much to catch.

      "Content: Something more beautiful -----The Shawshank RedemptionThis movie tells us a tale that takes place during the 1940's in a horror prison called Shawshank. The story is about a young banker named Andy Dufresne; a man was wrongly accused of murdering his wife though he was innocent. After Andy Dufresne was sentenced to Shawshank Prison, he must deal with those people despise and bully him, those brutal guards without any justice, and a corrupt warden who cannot do anything. Then he discovers the horror of prison. Prisoners in this prison seem to have been forgotten the hope and freedom which belonged to them. They forget how to live a free life and cannot think of some beautiful things outside the prison. Gradually, they get use to the prison life and give up the seeking of freedom. They become unconcerned and lose their faith, which is the most awful thing to one¡¯s life. In this prison he meets a man who has been sentenced to there for some time already, Red, who then strikes up the friendship with him. He is the narrator and is known as the guy who is able to get almost any type stuff from the prison. He helps Andy finding a rock hammer which helps Andy escape from the prison at last. What make me admire Andy most is his unremitting perseverance. He spends almost 20 years to dig a channel and escape outside from the prison just by a small rock hammer! One should not lose or give up his faith and dream, or just like a man without his soul. He cannot do nothing only knows he is surviving in the world like an animal. Courage is the motivations which stimulate you go ahead the success field in the dream. Andy writes a letter to Red after he gets outside. In the letter, such sentences like this:Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter findsyou, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy. I like the letter very much. It touches my heart deeply and makes me think much. I think about the life in the future, think about the meaning of my life. How should I do and which road I choose will make the life more meaningful? It is decided by yourself!Guangxi University of TechnologyForeign Language Department English Major Class022Yuanqiong Chen (Joan)\n",

Morgan Freeman is equally brilliant as Red, a fellow inmate who becomes Andy's confidant and friend.The film is beautifully shot and directed by Frank Darabont, and it's filled with memorable scenes and dialogue. But what makes The Shawshank Redemption truly special is its message of hope. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. And that's a message that we all need to hear.I highly recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lost or hopeless.

Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.\n",

      "Content: This film is packaged so maturely, I never imagined that this film would be so good.In terms of story, cast, music and shooting, all meet the requirements to be the best film. Not too many plot twists, but I never imagined that an innocent prisoner would do something crazy. A unique storyline, not many flashbacks but brings us to think about the problems of the main character in the past.This is a highly recommended film to watch at least once in a lifetime, it sounds a bit excessive but that's what I thought when I finished watching. This film is suitable for those of you who want lessons from people whose lives are not as smooth as yours now.Maybe this film is not the best overall, but this film is worthy of being compared to the best.\n",

      "Title: Touching, But a Theft Is a Theft\n",
      "Content: I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character, but this is definitely part of the theft.There are several others that I have forgotten. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the \"highly intelligent\" star, and the concentration on the \"hole\", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.Jeremy Barger\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption movie is one of the greatest films in history ever.The movies that were called the dark horse of the industry were unexpected and impressive movies that will stick in your mind for a long time. A drama film called Shawshank Redemption is the story of a banker, Andy Dufresne, who was caught up in the murder of his wife and her adultery then. Their story is about the rest of his life in the Shawshank prison, the friendship, and the pain of reality. One of the most interesting parts of this movie is that it is told from a third-person point of view, which gives a new perspective by using an indirect approach. It depicts a lot of inequity in prison life, but the focus point in this movie is hope. The hope that could rarely be found in a place that was called \"hopeless,\" such as prison, is the reason why the movie wants to show freedom in ways that people could never have imagined that people in prison would still have hope. This is not the normal prison film that audiences expect about jailbreak, but this movie leads to a different feeling. It's gained emotion through the situation that the characters have been through, and even more emotion is gained by the impressive ending. The movie always showed you some phases that demonstrated the truth of being human; that will definitely hit you. You will be able to relate a scenario, a character, or a situation in this simple movie to something deeply personal in your own life after experiencing it. This kind of movie is great to keep watching more than once because your thoughts and perspective on it will change as you grow up.\n",

What makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake.The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.\n",

      "Content: One of the greatest movies ever made. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a masterpiece in my eyes, with a perfect cast, score, direction, and writing. The film explores friendship, struggle, freedom and perseverance, and a film that is impossible to dislike in my opinion. I loved every single performance in that movie, from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown to James Whitmore, and the direction by Frank Darabont was extraordinary and he went on to direct more great movies including\"The Green Mile\" and \"The Majestic\". The story which was originally a short story by Stephen King was also one the best stories I've ever seen, along with a terrific and catchy score by Thomas Newman that could stay in my head for days, and I could not be tired of it afterwards.This truly one the greatest movies of all time and one of my favourite movies too, in fact I think is not only the Best movie of 1994, but the the best movie the decade, in my honest opinion. Films like The Shawshank Redemption are why I love the movies.\n",

      "Content: Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free – These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at stake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film.Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment.The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing!\n",

      "Content: This is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of being the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by suggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up whenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black penny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair and made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing Stephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film? They'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an interesting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp detritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched bathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor and his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they really trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a cell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering through and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the first place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners get moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff was hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may have stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old stalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know what really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's stirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the heavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers. And there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't duck prison rape.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is the most life affirming movie ever made. Through all the darkness, the pain and the heartbreak it's a testament to the perseverance of the human spirit that has one the most satisfying endings of all time, recontextualizing everything that's come before in the best way.At the centre of this movie is Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both giving the best performances of their careers. Robbins has a natural kindness and quiet nature that makes him a perfect fit for Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman's ability to give great speeches and narrate in an incredibly gentle way matches Red equally effectively.However, the film wouldn't be as satisfying if its villains weren't so detestable and Bob Gunton & Clancy Brown really excel in that department. They're monstrous with absolutely zero redeeming qualities in a way that isn't cartoonish or overly played. It's a very human evil.Frank Darabont's direction never loses sight of the humanity at this film's core and with perfect cinematography from Roger Deakins, it finds beauty in the darkest of places. Darabont's writing is phenomenal as well, the dialogue is iconic for a reason, so emotionally open and deep without the slightest hint of pretension or saccharine.\n",

      "Content: Shaw shank Redemption,is the best movie I have ever seen,which is different from common Hollywood story .The story is not complex , lacking of moving scenes which could be seen in many Hollywood stories .The director devotes to carefully picture the figures.It is the curiousness of the fate of Andy and Red that causes my interests. Andy if under a very awful situation.He is educated and thin , falling into a environment full of into violence ,if no painfulness and ill-treatment,it would be quite usual .Upon being put into prison,he firstly is a violence-taker.As an audience,at the very beginning,I could not tell Andy is not a murder,and hard to judge whether the adversities he gets are deserved.It is not a good element for recognition of a figure.The director solved this problem through Red¡¯voice incredibly.Voice out of the scene is to help narrator to complete the content which the pictures could not delivery.Especially,this movie is such long-lasting and large-contented one that needs voice out of movie so as to help us set up the recognition of Andy.Though the story by the time does not show how much good Andy has,we have liked him.When Andy helping the bad prison policeman,I did not blame the deed he did morally,but glad to see his situation turning well. With the emotional narration of Red,we could see more and more good form the inside of Andy.He relies on his knowledge and persistence, even regardless of the punish of being throw into a locked room, bringing knowledge ,music,not just spiritual change, but the hope of life .We also know that Andy is virtually innocent, when being informed that the president of prison letting the unjustic case of Andy alone instead of killing Tommy who is only one could proof Andy innocent. By the time, the audience tend to stand at the side of Andy and be angry with the innocent prison life of Andy. Andy finally escapes from the prison and takes away all the money from the president of the prison with illegal method.But no one is unhappy.This movie has a classical Hollywood end,but I do not think it is common, because I am fascinated by the story and hope to see such ending .It is the charm of Hollywood.\n",

      "Content: It's odd when I see this movie praised as the best or at least one of the best of all time. This is not to disparage it, for it's runtime it's engaging and I can't really point to anything that seemed horrid about this. And yet neither can I find much compelling, a feel good story with our protagonist working his way through his sentence and becoming better. The ending is easy to see from a mile away and while I like d the actors I couldn't find much to latch on to. But still it's not bad but I wouldn't rewatch it even knowing it's a good film as it gives me nothing to want to come back to. I do think it's worth your time if you want a solid movie.\n",

      "Content: This movie (Shawshank Redemption) is a pathetic ripe off of escape from Alcatraz and some other fine movies. kign even says he based the book on movies he saw growing up. if you plagiarise more then one source its still plagiarism. I thought the movie was decent until I saw Eastwoods movie, then I new itwas pure junk.steals the characters - steals even the pet animal - steals his job in the jail - steals the method of escapeShawshank Redemption steals everything but replaces Clint Eastwoods acting with amateurs. how Stephen King didn't get lambasted for plagiarism is beyond me. This must be something he only edited for his sack. I am sure most of the filming adding in these details and it doesn't even follow the book.I do not see how such a blatant ripe off is considered to be the best movie of all time by IMDb. It really takes away all of your credibility.Both movies using a poster to cover a hole in the wall. There are just far too many similarities between the two movies for this to be accepted. If this was a university paper I would expect an expulsion.I guess they figure they can change the old mans pet from a bird to a rat and everything is OK. because that clearly changes the entire story.Lastly no one in the movie was redeemed.\n",

      "Content: One of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker convicted of his wives (and her lovers) murder. When Andy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles, Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting, disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an incredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.\n",

The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good.

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: Written and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption is a film about a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly accused of and sent to prison for the murder of his cheating wife and her lover. During his stay in prison he becomes a financial adviser to the guards and the warden. The warden is involved in taking bribes and enlists Andy to hide this illegal money. Andy befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) the guy in the joint that can get things on the inside and they become close friends throughout the movie. This is a well written story and seemed to be a good escape from everyday life, but does not qualify as one of my all time favorite movies. I thought that filming most of the movie in a prison was kind of boring and the lack of action or any type of visual effects made it a little dull. This is not a movie I would watch again and again. The pace is just so slow.\n",

      "Content: This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories. Stephen King, who penned Stand by Me, also wrote the short story on which The Shawshank Redemption is based. Here we have all the things that made Stand by Me such a satisfying experience: lovable characters, writer flourishes, one- dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending. This one is far darker and far more violent than Stand by Me and so ought to be reserved only for older teens. The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film's duration.\n",

The film portrays how Andy Defresne, uses his banking knowledge to gain \"freedom\" from predatory inmates and the officers in charge of the prison. In the passage of time, he becomes hopeful and influential within the prison. This made him gain the respect of his co-inmates, especially longtime convict \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman) who became his closest ally. Andy eventually, achieves freedom by escaping.\n",

      "Content: The movie is well built and has a few exceptional moments. But it is fully (or as much as possible) understandable only in a certain key. And that key is religious, or rather spiritual. It belongs to a certain view over the world, and makes me consider how much some people believe that is the only correct view. I think it is called gnosticism. In its light the movie depicts life itself, transdimensional that is. The human existence on Earth is a punishment, a form of demotion for the spirits that inhabit the human bodies, and the \"angels\" are here to protect the rules by which these punished spirits in human bodies have to live. There is not much kindness or fairness in this existence, unless some individual way of transcending it cuts through the harsh rules. Aside this rather severe framework of things, the story may be captivating, perhaps more for down to earth people than for dreamers. It is a milestone movie, so better watch it for a personal opinion. My take on it however, is that if one disagrees with its \"key\", it may just fall apart a bit, or if one does not consider the key, the movie feeds a sum of concepts that really should declare themselves as such, to allow awareness when coming into contact with them.\n",

It leaves you feeling good at the end. It takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Its characters are complex. It appeals to every type of viewer on some level. It's phenomenally acted.This classic is rated higher than any other movie on IMDB because it manages to capture general audiences in a significant way, and it stays grounded with a focus on characters and relationships during hardships.It's not my favorite movie. Not even close. It didn't leave the same impact on me as other films.But I genuinely enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption, as does everyone. And I think that's the key.9/10.\n",

I can't say that about any other book vs movie.But as good as the story is; make no mistake about it; it is Darabont's MASTERFUL direction that makes this movie the greatest ever made.There is no way to accurately articulate the quality of this movie. A blu ray keeper from day 1.As usual, the Academy blew it. But this was their biggest failure ever. Forest Gump was a fine movie, but forgotten months after it came out. Shawshank has a legacy, as it should.The only one they got right, was Quentin Tarantino for original screenplay (Pulp Fiction.).But Best Picture, Best Actor, & Best Director should have gone to Shawshank; Freeman & Darabont respectively, hands down. Not even close. Of course, Tim Robbins outdid himself he was so good. He also deserved an academy award.Bob R.\n",

      "Content: I like \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" but cannot understand why it is rated so highly.  While it's well-acted, the direction is pedestrian, and the story is derivative.While it should be somewhere in the top 250, rating it above movies like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" \"The Seven Samurai,\" \"Chinatown,\" \"Memento,\" etc. strikes me as ludicrous.\n",

      "Title: Subtlety, and the Lack Thereof\n",
      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any film from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama. Orchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and plot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan would cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie is relatively laid back.Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to take its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a wrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has given up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their redemption.See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about the theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one of the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not the line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be a prisoner.The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain gang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact that a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in his cell.The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect this detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is reality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then immediately retract them.This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we watch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over and over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think it's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still, when it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same plot point, it's two and a half hours too much.\n",

      "Content: Shawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.The movie (directed by Frank Darabont) takes a straight-forward, soul- searching novel by horror icon Stephen King and transforms it into a somber, bloated prison drama designed to fill you up with inspiration.Thanks to supreme performances and beautiful cinematography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame. And you get generous helpings of the novella's deft ironic humour about a inmate quietly turning a corrupt system against itself.A small box office release which made its name once released on home video, this movie is well worth a watch if you happened to have missed it first time around.\n",

      "Content: I Thought this movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen next to The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, i don't know why its not there next to The Shawshank Redemption. I've watched this movie now a fair few times and on the special features on the DVD i seen the Director goes onto this site IMDb. And he also said that His movie has been in the top of the charts for years now been switching up and down between The Shawshank Redemption And The Godfather. I Think The Shawshank Redemption should be at number one because its just a pure inspiration to the movie industry and it should have a cinema anniversary or something with its 15th anniversary or something, i thought this movie was pure brilliant and i see everyone else nearly everyone else thinks the same, But it seems the director has only made one film that has been descent after this which was The Green Mile. That was good but not as good as The Shawshank Redemption, But good. Its seems the Director is an expert at Prison Films because he hasn't done well with his other films only 'The Shawshank Redemption And 'The Green Mile'. I Still think he's a really good director. I Own it on DVD and Own The Soundtrack, its brilliant , i love the songs from it. Anyway thats it, I Hope to make a film like this in the future as though I'm only 17 living in Ireland, The film industry in Ireland is rubbish so i struggling to get ideas of what i can do to push myself to an idea that could give me the lift tha ti need to star my film career alight, I Love films so much. Anyway thats it , I LOVE this film. PS . Sorry for the bad spelling i had typed a bit quick. Bye, Email me if your as interested in film as i, Or possible the director, if your looking at this could you email me, gives us ideas man, Cheers. , zkeveoz@hotmail.com Thanks Kevin Walsh\n",

      "Title: Generic review of Shawshank\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful tale of hope and friendship set against the grim backdrop of Shawshank Prison. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novella, the film follows Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted of murder, and his bond with fellow inmate Red. Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy, showcasing resilience and intellect, while Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red adds depth and warmth to the narrative. The film explores themes of freedom, redemption, and the indomitable human spirit, culminating in a poignant and uplifting finale. Its stunning cinematography and evocative score further enhance its emotional impact, making it a timeless classic that resonates with audiences long after the credits roll.\n",

      "Content: \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy everybody to watch it, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this, everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Title: Possibly the most overrated movie of all time\n",
      "Content: The plot and the sub plots are good but not great, which sums up most of the movie. Many of the characters are very one-dimensional, such as the Guard Captain, whose only characteristic is that he takes any chance he gets to abuse prisoners. The acting in the film is nothing special except for Bill Bolender who does a fantastic job in the few seconds he gets to play Elmo Blatch.What bothered me a lot and what makes the film noticeably worse than it could've been is Morgan Freeman's narration that spoon feeds the viewer with information that should've been communicated with the shots shown during the narration. Without the narration, the viewers would have been forced to focus on the actions, facial expressions and body language of the different characters to understand what they are going through. There is a reason to why Harrison Ford's narration in the original version of Blade Runner is excluded in the two later versions. There are many theories surrounding the ending of the movie, but in my opinion these theories only exist because the ending is so boring that people create better endings in their minds to make the disappointing movie they've just seen better. Strong 7/10.\n",

      "Content: I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb.I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess.So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy.End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile.I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.\n",

      "Title: The greatest\n",
      "Content: I remember years back when I was about 12 years old and had not seen many mature films like this my mum found this on the guide and told me to watch it. My mum isn't a huge film person but she was sure I would love this film despite the fact that my favourite films at the time were out there comedies like \"scary movie\" or \"hot fuzz\" (which I still think is a fantastic film). So as a kid who was extremely curious about what \"great films\" actually were and knowing that this film was highly regarded, I was very happy to sit down and watch a two hour prison drama.Never in my entire life had I been drawn to the screen quite as much as was watching the shawshank redemption, I was invested completely from start to end. As the credits began to roll I knew it was the greatest film I had ever seen, and I even remember stating to my mum who was doing the ironing at the time.To this day which I only half a decade of excessive film watching later it is still by far the best film I have ever seen and the one which means most to me. I don't think I need to go into why because there are already thousands of reviews out here which will go into far more depth and cover more things than mine ever could. Just know that if you haven't watched it then make sure you do whatever it takes to see the masterpiece whenever you get the chance to. For me and clearly many others this is the greatest film of all time.\n",

      "Content: Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as \"The Movie\". When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one.\n",

      "Content: I've read a lot of the comments here. I've never voted for this movie once, but now I'm going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to try to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best movie ever.The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting, incredible story-telling, incredible pace, incredible writing and dialogue, incredible imagery, and an incredible twist and ending.The Godfather also has these qualities.But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is potentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may believe in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better. They may truly believe others' lives can be made better. Its message is not only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for women, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What other movie affects people in this way? You don't get that with The Godfather. GF is a great film, but you just come out of it saying, \"Wow, that was one of the best films I've ever seen.\" With Shawshank, you say more than that. You feel more than that.You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future directors forever.\n",

Yes, it was an inspiring film and one of the few good screen adaptions of Stephen King's works. And yes, it was well acted and is one of the few movies released this decade that I could watch with my parents without being embarrassed.But to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time?  Really?  It was definitely a good movie, but I just can't see it as one of the All Time Greats.  If you want to talk about all those good points, then where is \"Stand by Me\"?  I would be much more likely to vote for it, but it still shouldn't clear the top 10!!While I can't think of anything that was bad about it, I just don't beleave that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has what it takes to be considered a classic.  It didn't really touch on any new ideas or delve deep into any volatile emotions.  And while it did give you something to think about at the end of the movie, it is not something stays with me like so many other truly classic movies do.Despite my misgivings on it's placement in movie history, I would still recommend it to anyone who asked about it.  But no one has ever asked, and I never really think of it.  It was good, it just wasn't all that memorable.\n",

      "Content: This movie should be seen by all the movie lovers. It express a lot of feelings. Mad, angry, love, friendship and a lot more. I could give 10 stars because simply it is the best movie ever. No fancy CGI just the pure genius of acting and a very good story line. The cinematography also outstanding. This movie is fit to be watched by all level of age. There are a lot of things that can be learned in the movie. Even it is screened on 1994, the quality of the movie is so amazing making its hard for the director to produce a better one. I hope there will be a lot more film that has the quality or a better one compared to The Shawshank Redemption.\n",

I think that as long as I has the spirit like his, I was success a half, so I will going on to this aim.The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man being charged with the murder of his wife and her lover and is consequently sent to Shawshank prison on two life sentences. Year after year, Andy faces more and more adversity, victimized by ruthless prison guards and malicious inmates, but combining his mentality, courage, determination and spirit, as well as his close friendship with veteran inmate Red (Morgan Freeman), Andy's journey becomes an utterly unforgettable one.The reason Shawshank is so good is because it's so incredibly moving and powerful. Up until the very last minute, you're drawn tightly towards the screen witnessing, step by step, Andy's growth in Shawshank prison. The acting is sublime, the dialogue is intelligent, the story is inspirational, the cinematography is breathtaking and every other little detail is done to maximum superiority.Above all, is my comment about this movie, and I hope have a communicate with you on the movie.\n",

The story is quite different to the short story by Stephen King but thats not necessarily a bad thing as the Green Mile followed the book closely and wasn't nearly as good as this! It says if you can to think of a film to compare it to but its in a genre all of its own. Other good prison films I could suggest are \"Against the Wall\" and \"Killer: A Journal of Murder\". Both of these are good but lack the depth of characters portrayed in Shawshank. For a good prison televisual drama then \"Oz\" has to be the best thing to come out of America after the Simpsons, it has the characters and plots to match Shawshank but generally without the feel good factor thrown in.\n",

In addition, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast create a collage of authentic characters that you both love & hate.

      "Title: Plainly Superb!\n",
      "Content: Let me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the other hand, there's a reason it's a personal favorite.The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's life in prison, relationships with other inmates (particularly with \"Red\" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and passion for life and freedom.I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He claimed it was \"too plain\" to be considered so great; my view was (and is) that it maybe be plain, but it's superb. The movie touched me when I saw it, Brooks' long life in prison (amazing acting by James Whitmore), Red's pragmatic persona and Andy's unyielding will and hope, all combines to an amazing movie.In my opinion this isn't some regular \"feel good movie\", it's much more. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or outstanding camera work – but it's plainly superb. The texts send shivers down your spine, Frank Darabont's screenplay adaption to Stephan King's short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast and in the end that's what really matters.I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I expect it'll remain as a cult favorite despite the \"no impressive effects and mediocre camera work\" as my friend put it.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's in my opinion one of the best movies of all time.\n",

It is a sad, funny at times and it is most importantly, Heart warming. For those of you that haven't seen it I tell you now, this is the best movie of the Nineties.Just another thing, I saw Forrest Gump and that was not as good as this.

      "Content: Ok, there are a ton of user reviews on here and everyone pretty much already established as to why this film is so incredible. That is undebatable at this point as far as I'm concerned. So, I'll just keep this short and to the point.Yes, it IS as amazing as people say. Is it a tad bit over rated? Yes, perhaps. This is in no way, shape or form the greatest film ever created. If someone told me The Godfather was, I'd agree with them more on that. Both wouldn't even make my top 10 or top 20....there are just too many extraordinary films out there. My personal #1 will forever be Dances with Wolves...now THAT is a true human and well told story in my eyes that in no way gets the props it deserves on here.But anyway....here's my main beef. If this movie IS indeed as well loved as it is today, then where are all of you supporting it? It has by far the most user ratings on here yet outside of this website the film is nowhere near a success.Now, I get it why it didn't do well at the box office (it flopped). It was a difficult film to market. Everyone just somehow overlooked it - heck, I didn't even watch this film for the first time until just 3 years ago - but then why did it also fail on home video? It's nowhere near one of the best selling films. Usually you show your love for a film by supporting it and owning it. Both Avatar and Titanic are two of the biggest selling (non animated films) of all time. I bet some of these same people who bought these films prefer Shawshank even, but didn't go out and buy it. And something like this I find upsetting.I don't think the close to 3M people on here even own the movie at all yet they claim it is the greatest they have ever seen.I just don't understand why a film everyone praises so much isn't supported. Go right now and buy it on DVD or bluray. Heck, I did and it's not even in my top 20. Maybe top 30, somewhere...but it still deserves a 10/10 from me and I'm just such film viewer with such varied tastes.(Ok, so this actually ended up becoming longer than I had intended.)\n",

Severe and unbearable rule and punishment, what¡¯s more, the same routine life; boring and dull make them isolated from the outside world. The high wall can isolate the freedom of the physical body, but it can't isolate the freedom of the mind. Andy Dufresne have strong will in his mind that hope is a good thing .his inmate friend red told him good is dangerous thing ,especially inthe jail. There can be miracles when you believe though hope is frail. It¡¯s hard to kill. Who knows what miracle you can achieve! Andy found many meaningful and beneficial things to do .during the imprisoned life time he is digging a channel led to the outside bit by bit. A continues dripping water can wear through a stone. we all know that life is too short for waiting, but I also know that life is long enough for doing something that really turns me on and energize me .......hope is a good thing always it is .after watched the movie, I thought a lot about my life .

      "Title: Best movie ever\n",
      "Content: This is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption1. It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, \"The Breathing Method,\" has not been turned into a movie.2. It's Similar to Tolstoy King's novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called \"God Sees the Truth, But Waits.\" Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didn't commit.3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King's Story He bought the rights from King for $1.4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the studio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reiner—director of another King adaptation, Stand By Me—and is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of King's books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the \"Rita Hayworth\" part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that she'd be perfect for the (non-existent) part of Hayworth.6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling.8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques.9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman's voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action (see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer) isn't simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the film's signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene.11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andy's rock hammer being tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of Exodus came from the film's prop master Tom Shaw.12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andy's Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins They're director Frank Darabont.13. Stephen King's Red Was Changed for the Film In the original novella, Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman.14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isn't Morgan Freeman It's actually a photo of his son.15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andy's letter Isn't in Fort Hancock, Texas It's in Ohio's Malabar Farm State Park.\n",

      "Content: Without the hope and freedom in our life, what should we do? Some people would fail to face to it,but the hero of the film is not a weak man as we image, he is a successor because he save himself.The Shaw shank Redemption is an old story .The young banker -Andy was undeserved, but was sentenced. In the long and hopeless time, people in the prison, not only to confront the wretched environment and the execrable turkey, but also to be controlled by the institution and to be hurt by the sore feeling. ¡°These walls are kind of funny like that: first you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time pass, get so you depend on them.\" The institution was deathly; did you have enough courage to suspect it? As the miserable old librarian in the film, he lived in prison for most of his life, he adapted the life of prison, and so he can't live without the acquaintance and familiar environment. What he only can do was to make himself evaporated in the world, which did not, belongs to him.But, for those execrable environments, Andy was a strong man although he looks gentle and weak .He did his work on his own way and kept the freedom in his mind. First, he learn to tough in the wretched environment, and then he became a hard-bitten person. Secondly, he also has the good friendship with his friends. Then they can help each other. Third, he can toady the person who can give him rights to prepare to flee for his life. Fourth, he caught opportunities for his life and believed every dog has his own day. Then did many things to prepare for the plan .19 years passed, with the freedom in his mind; he got his new life outside of the prison at last. The freedom belongs to him.From the film, I understand the truth: In the walleyed floor of despair, where is God? Everyone is God for oneself. If you give up yourself, no one can help you. But if you save yourself, the hope and freedom will belong to you one day!\n",

      "Title: The Shawshank Redemption\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. This film not only tells a captivating story, but it does so in a way that profoundly impacts the viewer, inviting them to reflect on fundamental themes like freedom, hope, and resilience. The way the main characters, especially Andy and Red, deal with their harsh circumstances inside Shawshank Prison is something that stays with anyone who watches the movie.From the beginning, the story hooks you with Andy's tragic situation, as he is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit. His transition from a successful banker to a common prisoner is heartbreaking and, at the same time, inspiring. Although Andy finds himself in an environment that seems to destroy all traces of humanity, he continues to believe in his innocence and, more importantly, in his ability to move forward. His determination to improve his surroundings and his capacity to endure hardships are aspects that inspire and demonstrate the power of human will.The relationship between Andy and Red is one of the strongest points of the movie. Red, who has spent so much time in Shawshank that he has lost all hope of ever leaving, sees in Andy a spark of optimism he no longer feels, something he left behind a long time ago. The way both characters evolve throughout the film is deeply emotional. Red represents the cynicism and resignation of those who have lost all hope, while Andy, even in the worst circumstances, holds on to an unshakeable faith that he will one day be free. Watching how this friendship develops and how Andy manages to influence Red to the point of restoring a hope he thought was long gone is one of the most beautiful elements of the story.The film doesn't just explore the relationships between the characters but also offers a critical look at the prison system. Shawshank isn't just a literal prison but a symbol of all structures that repress and dehumanize people. The system, represented by the corrupt warden and guards, seems to create rules solely to crush the prisoners' will and prevent any attempt at change or improvement. Andy's fight against this institution represents resistance against oppressive systems and the belief that human dignity is indestructible, no matter how hard the circumstances may be.Another aspect I want to highlight is the level of dialogue in The Shawshank Redemption, which is simply superb. Many of these lines are profound reflections on life, on how we face our circumstances, and on the importance of hope as a driving force in life. One line that impacted me greatly is when Andy tells Red, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" This phrase captures the essence of the movie, reminding us that hope, though fragile, is what allows us to endure even the toughest trials and keep moving forward.Furthermore, the technical elements of the movie are flawless. Frank Darabont's direction, the incredible performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the cinematography, and the soundtrack are all outstanding. Everything in this film is carefully crafted and executed to create a unique atmosphere that transports you to Shawsh.\n",

      "Title: The most impressive and unforgettable production in the history of cinema\n",
      "Content: \"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most impressive and memorable productions in the history of cinema. Directed by Frank Darabont, this masterpiece is based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\". In the movie starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the themes of hope, freedom and friendship are handled.Coming to the plot of the movie, a young and successful banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongfully sentenced to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. During this time, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and forges a strong bond of friendship. Thanks to Andy's wits and skills, he builds good relations with the prison warden and the guards, increasing his chances of survival. Throughout the film, the characters' difficulties and extraordinary events leave a deep impression on the audience.In particular, the emotional narration and sincere candor of Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, have a strong influence on the film's audience. Also, Tim Robbins' performance is admirable. The harmony of the duo and the story of the impressive characters form the basis of the success of the film.The technical aspects of the film also achieved great success. Thomas Newman's compositions and Roger Deakins' cinematography add to the atmosphere of the film. The realistic depiction of the Shawshank prison and the social structure of the USA of the time make the film more impressive.As a result, \"Shawshank Redemption\" has an important place in the history of cinema with its strong acting performances, impressive storytelling and unforgettable scenes. This work should be accepted as a work of art that shows that people should not lose hope and how valuable the pursuit of freedom is. If you haven't watched it yet, I definitely recommend you take the time to experience this excellent movie.\n",

      "Title: Enjoyable but vastly overrated\n",
      "Content: I read the short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" when I was in high school and enjoyed it quite a bit. I vaguely remember when this movie was in the theaters but I don't think anyone I know actually went to see it. Imagine my surprise, almost 10 years later, when it's rated the #2 movie ever made by IMDB users! Having finally had a chance to see the movie, I'm still just as surprised.This isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. In some ways, it's a very good movie. But it's certainly not a great movie. Better than Casablanca? Better than Citizen Kane? Better than The Seven Samurai? I don't think so. As cornball melodrama, it's not even better than the first Star Wars. What could possibly account for this movie's inexplicable popularity?As I say, it's not a bad movie. The acting is generally good, and Freeman and Robbins are both typically excellent. Roger Deakins' photography is, of course, gorgeous. The story itself is compelling (a \"page-turner\"), as are most of Stephen King's stories.Yet under it all, the story is just as much a fantasy as any of King's horror novels. While it's presented as a serious drama about prison life and the tenacity of the human spirit (and make no mistake, every emotion, every significant action in this movie is foreshadowed, highlighted and generally telegraphed to the degree that there's absolutely no doubt as to how the director expects you to react), the storyline and characters are so simplistically drawn that the movie wouldn't have rung significantly less true if an army of vampires had appeared in the final reel. This is a mawkish, sentimental and highly manipulative movie where the evil characters are pure, unadulturated evil and the good characters are the unsullied embodiment of pure nobility. It's the male equivalent of one of those Lifetime Channel movies where the woman's abusive boyfriend sleeps with her sister, steals her car, poisons her cat and kidnaps her developmentally disabled daughter to another state. It's pure melodrama, and while the great performances and photography make it enjoyable to watch, they can't change the fact that it is, Freeman's voice-over notwithstanding, a fairy tale.It's hard to really care for anyone in this movie because the characters and their struggles are so completely cliched and cartoony. There never seems to be the least chance of Robbins' sprit being broken and the rest of the prisoners rarely seem any more perturbed by their incarceration than the prisoners on \"Hogan's Heroes\". There is something of a plot twist near the end, but it's telegraphed almost two hours in advance and there isn't really any question of the movie ending up any differently than it does. What we're left with is a beautifully-filmed, well-acted movie without the slightest hint of subtlety, nuance or ambiguity. This is the sort of movie where it's not enough to give the hypocritical, self-righteously religious warden a wall hanging that says \"His judgement cometh, and that right soon.\" We also have to cut to a quick shot of the hanging right before the warden gets his comeuppance, just to make sure that not one single person in the audience misses the incredible irony.It's supposed to be a celebration of the triumph of the spirit, but since there never seems to be the slightest chance that Robbins' spirit *won't* triumph, we're left with no more genuine suspense than we would get waiting for the cavalry to appear in an old-time western. What could have been an above-average B-movie has been turned into an overwrought, ham-handed, pretentious melodrama.\n",

      "Content: This was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw it, i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving life sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen, and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is sent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie shows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest friend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as Andy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever seen.I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for every aspect of it. The Acting, directing, and writing, etc.\n",

      "Content: all I can say about this is that it is by a clear mile one of the best films ever made! the story line was gripping and intriguing, there was never a single dull moment and i can honestly say that this film is definitely one that i can watch over and over again without being bored. the cast really brought the characters to life and it was just such an emotional roller-coaster. if you have never seen this film before then i definitely recommend that you watch it! watch it on your own or with friends and family it really doesn't matter because i can guarantee that everyone will love it and if they for some reason don't then they clearly have no taste\n",

      "Content: I saw this movie for the first time when it came on television earlier this month. After seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out. The story was gripping and I especially liked the pacing, with the story moving along at a quick pace, covering years in a matter of minutes. The film was quite gritty and realistic throughout but started losing that quality as it started feeling more like a fairy tale towards the end.Although the story was initially focused on Andy, it later became quite apparent that Red was the true protagonist, who Morgan Freeman portrayed in one of his best performances to date. I believe Morgan Freeman deserved an Oscar for his performance, although he lost it to Tom Hanks, who gave an equally great performance in Forrest Gump that same year.Although I disagree with The Shawshank Redemption's ranking at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I believe it is worthy enough to at least be among the top 100 films. If I had to sum up the film in one sentence, I would say it is a very gripping and uplifting film to watch.8/10\n",

      "Title: The Best Film of All Time? Seriously, Folks?\n",
      "Content: With 11,297 imdb user reviews on record for this one film, who will ever actually read this one? Just for the sake of loyalty, maybe my dog, Peanut, will. He is, by the way, known to chomp on a \"ripe\" worm or two if he ever should get the opportunity.This is a very good film, but does it rate as the number one film of all time as imdb users believe that it does? As an old timer, I have certainly seen my share of prison films. This may be a generational issue, but, in my view, this could not possibly top classic prison films such as \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" with Paul Muni, \"Brute Force\" with Burt Lancaster, \"Caged\" with Eleanor Parker, or \"White Heat\" with James Cagney, which, oddly enough, imdb does not even include among its list of prison genre films.Tim Robbins gives a great performance, but he's no Cagney or Muni. He and Morgan Freeman are so low key at times that I actually had trouble staying awake through a film that was about 30 minutes too long, if not even more than that.The other issue that I have may pertain to the original novel by Stephen King. As I have never read any of King's novels, it is very difficult for me to judge them. I have, however, watched my share of film adaptations of King's books, and, while very entertaining, they almost always seem extremely far-fetched to me. I knew some really weird people in high school but no one even remotely as bizarre as Carrie White--or her mother, for that matter. Having traveled throughout the State of Maine for two entire years of my life, it was difficult to accept that such a large prison could be located anywhere in the state, and then I discovered that the prison used for the film was actually in the much more populous State of Ohio, which did not surprise me at all. Could anyone achieve the ultimate accomplishment of Andy Dufresne with the single resource at hand? And, just as one of many other examples, the prison warden and the really mean guard were far too one-dimensional for me. I got it, Mr. King. You have enormous contempt for organized religion, but what is your preferred form of spiritual bliss? Surely you have some remnant of immaterial, philosophical, or transcendental fulfillment, but I wouldn't know for sure.\n",

      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted from a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in International Cinema.The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very difficult to surpass.Wow!!What an on screen display by both of them. If Robbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of performance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James Whitmore as Brooks is a revelation,so is Bob Gunton as the warden.The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what happened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from this:Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music?Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.\n",

      "Content: The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we're told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he's this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies.\n",

      "Content: Is there anyone who does not like this film?  If there is, I've never met them.  \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a film that doesn't sound too interesting when you first hear about it.  A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better.  It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it.  Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect.  William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well.  James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod.  If you haven't seen this film go and see it.  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter.  Frank Darabont, who had been involved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this film.  Unfortunately, \"The Green Mile\" is nowhere close to comparing to this film which will be remembered forever.  A great achievement.  5 stars out of 5.\n",

      "Content: Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope.\n",

It can teach, heal, and inspire. Through The Shawshank Redemption, I discovered the boundless potential of storytelling and fell irrevocably in love with film as an art form.It reminded me that hope, even in the darkest corners, is the most powerful force we possess.

But to think that people consider this better than... just for a few examples... all the wonderful Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Leone and Welles films is shocking. The fact that \"The Dark Knight\" is higher on this list than \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is equally shocking. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is ranked higher than \"The Godfather,\" for Christ's sake!!! Of course, this is a list based on popular taste... not \"high culture.\" I have plenty of problems with high culture, myself. But I have even more problems calling this one of the greatest films ever made. Frank Darabont isn't even a GOOD director. He's turned out three solid films... and then a bunch of crap. His \"solid films\" are pretty hamfisted and corny. But then people continue to like crap like \"Gone with the Wind\" to this very day.It's amazing to think people like this film better than... say... \"Taxi Driver.\" It tells you something. Anyway, I could go on and on like this. If you enjoyed \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" it would be hypocritical for me to fault you that.

      "Content: If there's one film everyone must watch at least once, it's The Shawshank Redemption. No car chases, no explosions, no over-the-top action-just pure storytelling magic that grabs you from the first scene and never lets go.Set inside Shawshank Prison, the film follows Andy Dufresne, a man sentenced to life for a crime he may or may not have committed. But this isn't just another prison movie-it's a masterpiece about hope, resilience, and the quiet strength of the human spirit. Morgan Freeman's narration? Iconic. The cinematography? Stunning. The emotional depth? Unmatched.Every moment builds toward something bigger, and just when you think you know where it's going, it hits you with brilliance. This isn't just a movie-it's an experience, a lesson in patience and perseverance. And by the time the credits roll, you'll realize: this is what cinema was made for.\n",

      "Content: \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" These words, spoken by Red, encapsulate the very essence of \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" More than just a prison escape story, this film is a profound exploration of hope's power to sustain us through even the most brutal circumstances. Tim Robbins delivers a career-defining performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly convicted but never broken. Morgan Freeman's Red is the perfect foil, a cynical man whose spirit is reignited by Andy's quiet resilience. Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, creating a film that is both heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit.\n",

      "Title: Nice\n",
      "Content: Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption (Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New England banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life sentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves, rapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the veteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience.But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump.You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas.A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the character's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid, suggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate smolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul, makes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he says, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too used to movies like this one.

I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent.

      "Content: First of all I am by no means a Shawshank hater nor I'm I here to troll the film or its fans for it being ranked this high on the IMDb top 250. Shawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent performance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan Freeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I would not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty sure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even ranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use of story telling and making you study them in your head even after you've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that what ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me. The story was fairly predictable from start to finish and although I did appreciate its ending I found it to be too much your typical Hollywood sort of ending where every things happy and all loose ends have been tied up etc. I've now seen this movie four times and I must say I still find it to be very overrated, when I see it voted number two of all time then I think of how there are so many other movies out there not even in the 250. Oh well I guess popularity polls can never be just the way one would like them to be. Overall I give The Shawshank Redemption 6/10 stars I would have given it a seven or a eight only with the amount of high votes and rankings its got over the years on this site, I just felt it wasn't in need of such charity. As stated above a very enjoyable prison drama but just nowhere near in the same league as The Godfather, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogies. But hey thats only my opinion and thats what makes us all different isn't it?\n",

      "Content: Everyone who has watched \" Shawshank redemption\" knows that Andy was undeserved to be in prison. If it were you what would you do? Snarl? Complain the unfair society? I will probably get suicide for the innocence. For I am not strong enough and there is not so much power to support me to go on my life with such heavy burden. After sentenced to prison Andy was silent. However there was an underset hidden in Andy's heart while he looked quiet. ¡°Get busy living, or get busy dying¡± reminds me a saying by famous Chinese writer Luxun. That is ¡°break out in silence or perdition in silence.There is another set of dialogue that is impressive. Red: ¡°Hope is a dangerous thing¡± but Andy said: ¡°Hope is a good thing.¡± His escaping is the strongest evidence. Andy got a hope for which he can be busy. No other than this conviction set him free once more. Andy is a bird with beautiful feather and it is sin to forbid him in prison. Escaping is predetermined. Miracle is coming true by Andy's Rock-hammer.In the film, dialogue between Andy and Red and Red's monologue described vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may stimulate readers' inner billows better than exciting dialogue. Andy's guilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after locking in Shawshank prison for nineteen years.The heaviest burden of a person in one's lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots of lines in the film are valuable for us to take our time to taste it. And everyone shall remember that hope is a good thing.\n",

They simply survive.Someone who also doesn't like the film compares it to a fairy tale because it's unrealistic. This is an insult to fairy tales. Fairy tales are beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and carefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to get it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the hero's sidekicks are some nice criminals. Of course, prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the Bible yet acting in an un-Christian manner. Can you say anti-Christian bigotry?\n",

      "Content: THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ****A man sets out to scratch together some semblance of a life after he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  With the inmates taking bets on which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment, the movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted murderer and the prison handyman.  With a growing trust and bond that will stand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new prisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision and determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying his professional experience within the prison.The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we expect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots with such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double quick time.  Rarely do I get the feeling that a movie was totally seamless, but this was one instance.  The acting was first rate, with both Robbins and Freeman putting in the performances of a lifetime.  I must admit I haven't see much of Robbins' work, but if all his other performances slump to deep mediocrity he will still be remembered for his part here.  Freeman was superb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that hope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect of a mans' character, whether inside or out.To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other outstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men that keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their sentences.  The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the obvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted.  But emerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal, hatred, anger and injustice.  So too was there joy and relief, and a new perspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously hadn't thought of.Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies I have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with freedom.  For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was deeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh insight into prison life.  It is a wonderfully crafted film, and whilst I hate banding extreme and blind accolades at movies that can be taken as fads, this will probably stay in my top five favourite movies for it's enjoyment, its direction and it's comprehensive grasp of so many of it's focus points.  An outstanding movie.\n",

The end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a \"What's next\" Like no other.

      "Content: Playing a star is not because the film is poor, but I don't understand how it can be the top card in Douban movies. Use extreme stepping to balance the extreme support.I saw the film n years ago, and I thought it was really good. It's good. Where is it? Perhaps because of the happy ending, the protagonist finally managed to escape from prison and reach the dream place, so that the viewers could give themselves hope and think that they could reach the other place of freedom.After reading it for the first time, I actually only remember the story and the wonderful ending. After many years, I saw that Douban scored high, and I couldn't help but revisit it with the question \"Is it that good?\" I still think it's a wonderful movie, and I still don't understand why Douban scored so high.In the film, the life in prison gets up at one o'clock, goes to bed at one o'clock, lights out at one o'clock, and the librarian distributes books. The idea that such a regular life suddenly flashes is actually quite like the life of sending students to school. I thought that the dormitory with a big bird cage in the school would squeeze eight people into the bunk bed, so I teased that the cell could be a single room, which was really happy.If the protagonist Andy is persistent and persistent, we ordinary people can do it as long as we work hard. Then his genius and all-round talent can no longer be achieved by ordinary people simply by hard work. I have to admit that there is such a thing as genes. The bible is loose, and the chapters and sections are clearly remembered, which confirms a famous saying: a genius must have an excellent memory. Therefore, as a banker, it is natural to be familiar with the tax regulations, and accounting work is a piece of cake for him. He is also a geological enthusiast, who knows a lot about stones, seems to be a sculptor, knows music and is good at teaching.Was deeply hit. Because it's easy for people like me to be jealous of people with good memories. Genius like this takes several months to remember all the books, while ordinary people take several years. It takes ordinary people a lifetime to read the books in a year, so the gap between the depth and breadth of people's knowledge is thus revealed.People like Andy are gods, just like Jobs, which is not what ordinary people can achieve by reading a few inspirational books and watching a few inspirational movies. But ordinary people are easily excited about such a genius and its success. I don't know what I'm excited about. It's not like we have a high IQ and we have to work hard.Perhaps this film is given so many five stars because it expresses our desire for freedom and realizes our hope for freedom. But after reading it twice, I found that it actually gave most ordinary people without talent and perseverance the despair that they could not be free.A genius like the hero depends on perseverance and talent, and it takes nearly 20 years of youth to build a tower of freedom. Those who have little talent but persevere are lucky enough to realize their wishes before dying. And most ordinary people who have nothing will only get excited when they see a mirage of freedom.I said that most people have no ability to be free. This \"ability\" is not only IQ, EQ and other qualifications, but also how much desire and respect a person has for freedom. Letting yourself be free is not based on destroying the freedom of others. Freedom is not the pursuit and dream of all people moaning about it, but the heart is \"I love the system, it gives me security and a sense of security\".It is better to say that we are only worth one star than to give this film a star: we keep saying that we yearn for freedom and complain about institutionalization, but in fact we are willing to enjoy the benefits brought by institutionalization (since the system has its own freedom, please don't complain); We shouted for freedom, but we laughed and crowded into the crowd on holidays to watch the animals and their performances in the aquarium of the zoo, thinking that animals love to be imprisoned and shown to people. (I wonder how many animals are used to this way of life, just like BROOKS who stayed in prison all his life in the film, and how many really love show), When we see that swans can only swim back and forth in the waters the size of a zoo ditch for ten seconds, birds can't fly under a net three or four meters high, and dolphins can't jump freely in the sea, if we can still laugh, please don't say how much we want to respect freedom and don't deserve five stars for this movie.-write this article to yourself and inspire yourself and those who are also lacking or losing perseverance, stick to it like Andy, and one day get the freedom you want!\n",

      "Title: Movie Honest Review\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to two consecutive life terms at Shawshank prison, Andy faces the harsh realities of prison life. There, he befriends Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has been in prison for decades. Over the years, Andy and Red form a deep, life-changing friendship. Andy's unwavering hope and resourcefulness lead him to not only survive but also make a lasting impact on the lives of those around him. His journey teaches Red the power of hope and redemption, even in the most dire of circumstances.Directed by Frank Darabont and adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film masterfully explores themes of friendship, freedom, and the human spirit. Through Andy's determination and intellect, he finds ways to cope with the system while also helping others, including aiding in the prison's financial management and improving conditions for his fellow inmates. The film's emotional depth, powerful performances, and timeless message of never giving up hope resonated with audiences, even though it initially struggled at the box office. Over time, The Shawshank Redemption gained critical acclaim and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, frequently topping \"best of all time\" lists.\n",

      "Title: Perfection: hope, emancipation and the inviolability of the human spirit\n",
      "Content: The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film.  It is flawless fundamentally because of its deep love of storytelling, and because underneath each layer of the film lies a whole world of meaning.  It has universal appeal and can teach everyone something about the power of hope and the inviolability of the human spirit.I love this truly inspiring film because of its boldness to persuade people to never give up hope, even in the direst of circumstances.  Its audacity can be seen in its choice of setting: in a prison, where hope is fragile and can easily become a casualty.  But this situation is readily adaptable to any other.  People, habitually, are trapped.  Trapped by relationships, fear, responsibilities and their own inadequacies.  The prison metaphor just serves to give shape and direction to this feeling of entrapment.We identify with Red (Morgan Freeman), because Andy (Tim Robbins), for quite a substantial amount of the film, remains an enigmatic and aloof character. But we know that Andy's state of mind and hope is such that it has the potential to transcend prison walls.  Metaphorically.  Literally.  This is explored in the scene where Andy, after spending a fortnight in solitary confinement for sending operatic music resounding through the prison, says the time was easy because he had the music in his head and heart.  He notes: `here's where it makes the most sense.  You need it so you don't forget there's something inside that they can't get to, they can't touch, it's yours  hope'.  Indeed his mental well being is akin to an ideal state, and as such the average audience cannot identify with him.  At this stage neither can Red.  When Andy gives him the harmonica, a symbol of hope, Red is still not ready to accept it as a means to salvation. However, in the book Red acknowledges that `Andy was the part of me they could never lock up, the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk out.'But Andy is after all only human, and the trials he undergoes makes us deeply sympathetic to his situation.  The possibilities that had previously given him hope rapidly erode as the harsh realities of prison life bear down on him.  Before he had noted facetiously that a `convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning' was a `wonderful pet to have', but now realizes that the warden and the guards simply and fundamentally, don't care whether he lives or dies, as long as it's on their terms.  He acknowledges his only choice left, deceptively elementary but truly universal in scope: `Get busy living or get busy dying'.This choice is evinced through the character of Brooks.  When his parole comes through he sadly frees his bird Jake who flies away, instinct taking over his initial domestication.  Brooks is also in a sense a bird, but of a different feather  a `jail bird', who is `institutionalised', or domesticated and thus cannot cope with the immensity and the possibilities of mental and spiritual freedom.  Walls bind his world, and as such, he cannot bear to live in a world without boundaries.  As depicted in this film, prison restrains physical freedom, but ironically enough, its lasting effects restrain the spirit.  As Red bitterly notes: `They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take.  The parts that count anyway.'A wonderful shot of Red near the end sees him narrate that on the outside he feels as scared as Brooks did, and frequently entertains the idea of breaking his parole so he can return to prison, `where things make sense'. The fact that he repeats a lot of Brooks' dialogue shows how close Red came to succumbing, and the strength of Andy's friendship with him.  The camera sweeps over a selection of guns, but an array of compasses step into view. Red fingers one and remembers the promise he made to Andy.  This signifies an immutable truth: that hope and direction combined can see a man achieve grandeur.The audience's collective spirit soars with Red who takes Andy's advice, and lets the possibilities of freedom penetrate his self, which is his ultimate redemption.  An element of the film surpasses the novella  that of the phrase Warden Norton utters to Andy: `Salvation lies within.'   This is shown to be wholly accurate on both a metaphorical and literal level.The film judiciously avoids trying to make the audience sympathise with the other prisoners who are collectively rapists, murderers and deviants.  As such, their reason for imprisonment is either humorously blamed on incompetent lawyers or not touched upon at all.  This prevents the sympathetic focus straying from Andy and Red; Andy who is innocent and Red who describes himself as the `only guilty man in Shawshank'.Morgan Freeman is characteristically excellent as he has the ability to effortlessly inject integrity and a noble presence into each of his roles. He should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1995.  Tim Robbins is sublime, though to a lesser degree than Freeman.  Supporting cast is wonderful: James Whitmore's poignant representation of Brooks, Bob Gunton's anal-retentive Warden Norton, Gil Bellows' cocky but well-intentioned Tommy Williams.  William Sadler and Clancy Brown are also strong.One tagline of the film descriptive of Andy is `It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.'  In King's novella Red describes Andy through bird imagery, repeating the motif associated with Brooks: `We're glad he's gone, but a little sad too.  Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all.  Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild.  So you let them go ",
      " And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.'  Not so for Red, however.  His last words  `I hope.' are testament to this.\n",

Over the years, watching it again and again has only made me love it more. It's got this timeless storytelling, deep themes, and unforgettable performances that stick with you.The cinematography and music are also top-notch. There are so many memorable scenes, like those moments of personal triumph and connection between characters. Thomas Newman's score perfectly captures the emotions of the film, making those key scenes even more powerful.The supporting characters add so much to the story too. From the harsh prison officials to the diverse group of inmates, each character brings something unique to the table, making Shawshank feel like a real, living place.What really stands out to me, as a Korean, is the movie's universal message of hope and redemption. In a culture that values hard work and perseverance, Andy's story is a powerful reminder that hope can prevail even in the darkest times. His journey is inspiring for anyone facing tough challenges.Watching this movie as a kid and then again as an adult, I've come to appreciate its many layers and emotional depth. It's a testament to the human spirit, a story that transcends cultural boundaries and speaks to the heart of what it means to endure and overcome.\n",

The reason for the great love of this movie and its highest rating on IDMB for 26 years is its great story and the amazing performance of its film characters in the movie, especially in the opening scene; The camera takes us and puts us in prison, as if we are not only watching from the outside! We meet prisoners and we become a part of their lives.Instead of focusing solely on Andy the hero, the movie takes us to live with the rest of the prisoners the details of their lives.\n",
      "Director and screenwriter Frank Darabont proves that you don't need action scenes and special effects to make a great movie. Brilliant acting and deep intellectual narration It is enough to make it a masterpieceThe Shawshank Redemption is a poem containing mysticism that takes you thinking and inspiration to milestones, prospects, and life themes such as hope, love, freedom and life.This movie is seen as the best over the past 26 years and is the best motion picture ever.\n",

      "Content: No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. In the shawshank redemption, andy dufresne (tim robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with red (morgan freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc. All in 19 years.Only grossing about 70 million in the box office, the shawshank redemption is the best example of \"don't judge a book by it's cover.\" the movie accurately portrays the cruelty and brutality of life in prison by highlighting the struggles and suffering of every prisoner in different circumstances. As a result, it came across as very sentimental and moving. In addition to that, the determination to adapt is stressed on in this movie. If you ever need reassurance on the fact that all obstacles can be overcome, this movie is exactly what you need. It portrays the cliché \"nothing is impossible\" motto better than any movie has ever done.Other than the message of the movie, the acting was phenomenal. Tim robbins gave a truly inspiring and intelligent performance. In prison, robbins's character becomes friends with red (morgan freeman), who also gives us an amazing performance. These 2 show us the importance of friendship with their inseparable bond that can be detected from the very first scene, which also helps them survive day-to-day life in prison.With a limited set, director and writer frank darabont showed us what good writing really is. His use of irony and symbolism in the movie is like icing on cake. The movie also included shocking plot twists and an even more shocking resolution which resulted in a beautiful ending.Nominated for 7 academy awards, this film might be the best that never won an oscar.Score:9/10.\n",

      "Content: STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn 1947,banking boss Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and given two life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State Prison.Keeping himself to himself and giving off a slightly aloof vibe,Andy finds it hard to settle in at first,but then he develops a friendship with prison fixer Red (Morgan Freeman) which comes to stand the test of time between life within the confines of Shawshank...and even outside it.Stephen King adaptations are things that generally seem to have trouble even becoming watchable things on the big screen,let alone spell-bindingly brilliant pieces of work.So,it is credit to director Frank Darabont,who would later go on to helm another SK adaptation,the only slightly inferior Green Mile,that he has managed to do just that.Of all the Stephen King books and short stories that I've read,I've never actually come across Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,yet I was still able to appreciate this films on all the levels it deserves to be appreciated on.Everything just comes together and works like magic.On the performances front,as the narrator and co-star,Freeman adds solid,engaging and memorable support,but it has to be said he's been in better roles and,for all he's worth,he's outshone in the leading role by Robbins,who rightfully earned the Oscar nomination,and was only cheated in not getting it.He delivers a powerful,intensely focused portrayal of a man who appears in complete acceptance of all the events that have transpired around him and is fighting his own personal demons to adapt to the changes that are happening all around him.I don't think I can remember him delivering a more entertaining performance in any other film I've seen him in.Other great support comes from Bob Gunton as the bible-preaching yet corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as his sadistic right hand man/guard,but,in fairness to them all,they all take a back seat to Robbins.Despite it's grim themes,the film somehow also manages to be a beautiful one of hope.\"Get busy living...or get busy dying\" says Andy,high-lighting how from the direst of situations,what one makes of it can ultimately deaden despair and bring...well,hope.The topic of how incarceration can bring about institutionalization is also brought up,and how,for those serving life sentences,the ultimate punishment,having spent most of their life in jail,is to be freed at all,to a world that will have passed them by and an age they will struggle to come to terms with.\"When they send you to Shawshank State Prison,that's exactly what they take...your life\",another line from the film that captures perfectly what it's trying to say.Some would appear detracted that the film has a presentation that is more fitting to a TV movie than a major Hollywood production.But considering it could be put in the same league as all the effects-reliant blockbusters,the further the film could do to distance itself from those kinds of film,in my opinion,the better.In it's tenth anniversary year,this is a film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Considering all the rubbish that gets released nowadays,it's good and refreshing to know that as comparatively recently as ten years ago,it was still possible to see quality stuff like this emerge out the woodwork every so often.I consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made (thoroughly deserving of it's position at No.3 on the IMDb Top 100 list!) and easily on a par only with Stand By Me as the greatest King novel to make it to the big screen.It truly is a film of majestic quality and brilliance.*****\n",

      "Content: When I searched amongst the endless lists of reviews given about this movie, I had not found one that gave it less than 7 stars. In order to truly see a movie for what it is, one must look past all that makes it great into its minor flaws and weaknesses. If you (the reader) were drawn to this review because of the low rating, well I am sorry but I have mislead you. However, I have also led you to something greater and different from the rest of the reviews for this film.To get to the point, Shawshank Redemption is magnificently made and deserves incredible amounts of praise for its entertainment value and perspective on life in prison. However, the themes of the film are rather shallow. The entire theme can be summarized in a short sentence: Friendship and hope can get you through almost anything. Although it is a great message, it is simply a nugget of what could have been much greater.Now I know that I have only given the film 1 star here, but that was only to draw attention so that you may finally see that this film, although superb, is not perfect by any means as is suggested by the vast quantity of perfect reviews. In all honesty I would give it nine stars out of ten and would encourage everybody to see it.Great, not perfect, but after all, where can true perfection honestly be found?\n",

      "Content: There are not many movies that can touch me emotionally. Few movies have done this and those movies are: The green mile, The gladiator, Crash and Shawshank redemption.This movie makes you feel like you have known the persons in the movie all your life. It lets you understand them and love them. It shows you what true friendship is and that how dark things look there is always a light at the end and that things don't always go like you want it them and that you should do your best making the best of all situations. Like i have said one of the best movies i have ever seen, not a doubt in my mind giving it 10 stars. Gordon Freemans voice is a pleasure hearing and makes you really listen to the story.For you people that haven't seen the movie yet its about a young man that is a banker. Hes wife cheats on him and he gets convicted of murdering her and her lover. This young man gets to the prison \"Shawshank\" and has a rough time. Paying his sentence he starts to make friends and some of them are powerful. This gets him in trouble but he is always one step ahead of his powerful friends that become enemies that get him in trouble making life impossible for him. At last he makes it and everything goes as planed.Sorry if my short version of the movie is a bit diffuse but this movie is too good to spoil even a little bit.I know you will like it as much as i did.\n",

      "Title: A Moving, Cinematic Classic!\n",
      "Content: The first thing that really struck me after watching Frank Darabondt's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was how much it resembled parts of the plot, but most of all the feel of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. What is THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really about? Yes, it's about a hellish prison, it's about how corruptible some human beings can be, it's about the good and the bad and the ugly of humanity, it's about depression, it's about yearning for belonging, it's about hope but most of all (like of MICE AND MEN), it's about one, truly glorious friendship. I do (of course) refer to the brilliant and heartwarming bromance shared by one Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and one Red (Morgan Freeman). It's their tale of friendship and sacrifice that takes place in the living hell that is Shawshank prison and their brutally honest story is brought, magnificently to the screen by Frank Darabondt.Every, single, vital element of this film is done to cinematic perfection: the writing, the directing, the cinematography, the scoring and of course the acting. All these elements are executed perfectly and the story is told with poignant, brutal, raw honesty. It makes you immediately stop and think about the days when \"prison\" meant prison and how if you went down, you were as a good as dead. We see this by the horrendous cruelty that Andy experiences at the hands of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), the vile, rapist inmate Bogs (Mark Rolston) and finally, by the black hearted and truly evil, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). We see men, in short, treated and brutalised like animals. We see men suffering from utter hopelessness and depression but still trying to build a life around their grieving situation. However, we also see the lighter side of things and this is where the film is most moving; we see people making a working environment in prison and how they carry hope with them (some, more than others) and try their best to live a productive life in a harsh environment.Darabondt brings this to life epically; he directs perfectly, getting the uttermost from his cast and pulling everything together marvellously, he writes powerfully, breathing real life to each character and clearly marking out the heroes and villains. He makes you feel about each and every character and you end up truly caring about their hopes and dreams for the future. Like I said, this film (I believe) owes much to OF MICE AND MEN and as we focus on Andy and Red, (I think) you can appreciate how much they both resemble George and Lenny. They care and love each other almost like brothers and share a wonderful dream of someday escaping their current hell and living the dream. Sound familiar? He is a truly talented writer and with the script, as well as being able to make you shocked, horrified and sad, he can also make you laugh, make you happy and make you charmed as you behold the lighter side to the life in Shawshank. In short, Darabondt pulls together a truly marvellous piece of cinema that captures the inner turmoil and quest for hope and peace of the human spirit.However, Darabondt's brilliant directing is not the only great thing about the film. The cinematography in this film was simply breathtaking, courtesy of the great Roger Deakins. I always love the poetic way in which Deakins tells a story with the camera. It feels poetic and mystical: the way in which the camera flies over the prison inmates, Andy in the sewage pipe, Andy in the rain and the beaches around the Atlantic Ocean. Wether it's BLADE RUNNER 2049 or SICARIO, Deakins captures the spirit of every story he films perfectly and is a true artist with the film camera.Another great thing about the film is the score, courtesy of Thomas Newman. It builds throughout the film with a combination of soft piano and strings. His composing is filled with such poignant emotion and poetry and it really struck me how much this score resembled his work for Sam Mendes's 2002 thriller ROAD TO PERDITION. In both films, the score lifts each scene and makes the film powerful and poignant. \n",
      " \n",
      "Finally, the true brilliance of the film (or, when you think about it, any film) lies with its cast. The cast for this film was truly magnificent with some of the 20th centuries finest actors giving it their 110%! The main standouts are (without a doubt) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins is powerfully poignant and moving as the movie's wronged hero. He steals every scene as his face paints pictures of sorrow, regret, depression and gentle optimism. He makes you feel so much for the character and you almost feel as if you're going through life in Shawshank with him. Put it this way: his performance in this film couldn't be further from his performance in something like THE HUDSUCKER PROXY! Morgan Freeman was also frankly masterful in this film as he shows what a truly talented actor he is. His portrayal of a worn-out but kindhearted individual is heartwarming and sincere but also his methodical, poetic, poignant, and now famous narration is truly marvellous. The story is really lifted with his virtual fairytale narration and to quote from TED 2 (as said to Freeman) \"I could go to sleep on a bed made of your voice!\" Everyone else in the film is marvellous so its hard to pick who else deserves a mention, but I think you definitely have to mention Shawshank's vile Warden Norton, played by Bob Gunton. At first, he pretends to be a firm but fair teacher with good, pure values, but as the film progresses, you see that his heart is as black as the some of the prisoners he keeps. He's ruthlessly ambitious and hides behind the facade of protector. He's truly as \"boo and hiss\" sort of villain and Gunton plays the character perfectly!All these wonderful factors carried the film along to its shocking but wonderful conclusion. I won't spoil if you haven't seen it but I will say that the film truly ends, perfectly!THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION captures what many films have tried to and failed: the human nature! I've seen very few films that capture the human nature in such a raw and uncompromising way. It's a truly masterful piece of cinema and probably the best 'prison movie' since COOL HAND LUKE...\n",

      "Title: A Timeless Journey of Redemption\n",
      "Content: **Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption***The Shawshank Redemption* (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption*, is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time, continuously finding new audiences decades after its release. Its emotional depth, impeccable performances, and timeless themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance have cemented it as one of the greatest films ever made.Set in the 1940s and 1950s, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy's journey of survival, dignity, and quiet rebellion against an unjust system unfolds over the course of two decades. At the heart of this journey is Andy's friendship with Ellis Redding, or \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has spent much of his life in Shawshank. Through their bond, the film explores themes of institutionalization, the corrosive effects of power, and the redemptive potential of human connection.**Performances**The film's success is largely owed to its outstanding performances. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy Dufresne, a man who, despite being wrongfully imprisoned, maintains an air of quiet dignity and unshakeable belief in his own innocence. Robbins doesn't rely on overt emotional outbursts but rather expresses Andy's inner turmoil through subtle gestures and a calm demeanor, making his character's transformation from a man broken by injustice to one who finds hope in the most unlikely of places profoundly affecting.Morgan Freeman, as Red, gives a career-defining performance. Red's voiceover narration throughout the film serves as a guide, offering the audience access to his internal thoughts and reflections. Freeman imbues Red with a wisdom that only comes from years of living within a system designed to strip away one's humanity. His portrayal is warm, grounded, and deeply empathetic, drawing the audience into the emotional heart of the story. It is through Red's eyes that the audience sees the slow unfolding of Andy's incredible journey, making their friendship the emotional core of the film.**Direction and Cinematography**Frank Darabont's direction is nothing short of masterful. He captures the harshness of Shawshank prison without ever indulging in melodrama, focusing instead on the characters and their emotional landscapes. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully absorb the passage of time and the transformation of the characters. Darabont's use of space within Shawshank creates a sense of isolation, with the imposing walls of the prison acting as a metaphor for the emotional imprisonment of its inhabitants. Yet, the film also makes use of its natural surroundings-such as the scenes set by the beach in the final act-to emphasize the sense of liberation that is so central to the story.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is stunning, capturing the bleakness of Shawshank and the occasional beauty found within it. The contrast between the dark, oppressive interior of the prison and the occasional bursts of light and nature outside reinforces the themes of hope and freedom. The most iconic visual moment is the image of Andy standing with his arms spread wide against a downpour of rain-a symbolic moment of release and renewal. This frame has become one of the most recognizable in cinematic history, representing the film's central message: even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always hope.**Themes and Symbolism**At its core, *The Shawshank Redemption* is a story about hope. Andy's journey is a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure even the most harrowing conditions. While Shawshank is a place where men are broken, Andy refuses to let the system strip away his sense of self. Through his intelligence, resilience, and quiet rebellion, he retains a sense of agency. His ability to maintain hope, even when it seems utterly hopeless, makes him a symbol of inner strength.In contrast, Red represents the danger of losing hope. Having spent decades in prison, Red initially believes that life outside Shawshank is impossible for men like him. His eventual rediscovery of hope, spurred by Andy's friendship, is one of the film's most powerful moments. Red's eventual release from Shawshank is not just a physical one, but an emotional and spiritual one as well.The film also explores the theme of institutionalization-the idea that the prison system, instead of rehabilitating individuals, often dehumanizes and destroys them. The character of Brooks (James Whitmore), an elderly inmate who struggles to adjust to life outside Shawshank, embodies this theme. Brooks' inability to cope with freedom after decades of imprisonment underscores the damaging effect of a system that strips men of their agency and humanity.Moreover, the film is rich with symbolic elements. The most prominent of these is the role of books and education in the lives of the prisoners. Andy uses his skills to improve the lives of those around him, including creating a library and tutoring inmates. This is not just an escape from the prison's physical walls, but an act of rebellion against the intellectual confinement the institution tries to impose on them.**Legacy and Impact**Despite a lukewarm reception at the box office upon its release, *The Shawshank Redemption* has since become a beloved classic. It has consistently ranked as one of the greatest films of all time in numerous polls, including being #1 on IMDb's Top 250 list. Its themes resonate deeply with audiences worldwide, and it has found a lasting place in pop culture.The film's exploration of the human capacity for resilience, redemption, and the power of friendship speaks universally, transcending its setting and characters. *The Shawshank Redemption* reminds us that even in the most oppressive circumstances, the human spirit can endure, and in the end, freedom is not just a physical state, but a mental and emotional one.**Conclusion**In summary, *The Shawshank Redemption* is a film that speaks to the heart of what it means to be human. With its incredible performances, masterful direction, and exploration of hope, freedom, and friendship, it remains one of the most enduring cinematic experiences. It's a film that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit and reminds us that, no matter how dire the situation may seem, redemption is always within reach.\n",

      "Content: I have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that I've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and I've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated novellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to the movie in question.I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually expected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost sociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James Whitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond.The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's probably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the longest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration, and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way.A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended.\n",
