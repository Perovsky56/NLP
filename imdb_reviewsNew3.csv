Just Fabulous- A Timeless Masterpiece;"Morgan Freeman, in one of his most iconic roles, gives an outstanding performance as Red.

An excellent film contained within a classic;"When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film.

A fine movie, but a few things bug me.;Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time.I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250.Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump.;7;2;2;Good Movie.

A Good Movie;"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.";10;1;0;"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary.

It's a pity that we don't have such good actors in the film world anymore. Starring these two legends is already champions league level. People I definitely recommend this movie!!!

Should be considered in the genre of fantasy;This film is exceptional.In terms of reality it's nonsense but that shouldn't be a barrier.Personally, I don't think it's worthy of being top on IMDB despite being a stunning film. There are other films that are better at fantasy, there are better films about crime and injustice set in reality.However, there are few movies that are as emotionally moving as this if you have a soul of any kind and ignore the farcical nature of a prison system in the 1940s then the film is pretty, pretty good.I was struggling as to whether five this film 10 stars or 4!! Wjich might seem off but after tons of viewing, i would still watch it again and again.;8;1;0;This film is exceptional. In terms of reality, it's nonsense, but that shouldn't be a barrier.

A harsh tale that lifts you again and again;"I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy's. His fears, his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer, Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his perseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life outside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It's only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it, it's just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little ""pick-me-up"".";10;2;1;"I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before.

My take on the film;"I was amazed, encaptured and enthralled when I saw this film for the first time. I was flicking idly through the television one night when I caught the opening titles just as I was about to go to bed, and thought I'd give it a try. What can I say? 3 hours later I was almost in tears over the ending, but I'll say no more.It's obvious the film has overwhelming themes of hope, friendship, redemption ad freedom, but it is the hope that so suffuses the film and lifts it above other ""triumphing over adversity"" films. It is a film that does not try to justify any governmental or judicial system, or the skill of a lawyer, but simply the hope and compassion that is part of the tarnished human spirit.I bought this film on DVD recently, replacing my rather elderly tape, and it cost me the grand total of £3 (about $5 or so) and, pound for pound, it's the best value for money I've ever spent on anything. If only all DVD's were this good and this cheap.";10;1;0;"I was amazed, encaptured and enthralled when I saw this film for the first time.

Not the best but still excellent;"It is not my favourite movie ever but it works for almost everyone. That is saying a lot.
It has emotion and it is difficult for me to find a movie so moving as this one, without being manipulative and cheesy. Hollywood seems stuck in creating much noise at first glance and being empty at posterior views. Here, it worked for me since the first view. The emotion is always there, sometimes taken from the dialogue, or from the soundtrack, or the unexpected direction the movie takes.";7;0;0;It is not my favourite movie ever, but it works for almost everyone.

Not bad, but Seriously Overrated;"This is not a bad film, and I would recommend renting it. But its admirers who rank it as one of the best films of all time -- even above classics like Citizen Kane or The Godfather -- are seriously overrating it.The popularity of this film apparently comes from its uplifting message about the power of hope. Nothing else in Shawshank Redeption is extraordinary. The acting is only good: indeed, Tim Robbins's acting of Andy Dufresne is two-dimensional. Morgan Freeman is much better as Red. The photography is unremarkable. Most seriously, however, the moral dilemmas in this film are melodramatic and black-and-white. Andy Dufresne is impossibly noble. The guards and, especially, the warden are unbelievably evil and corrupt. It's nice to think a prison would be reformed by building a nice library. But sorry, folks, the world is more complicated than that. At best, this film can be enjoyed as a kind of uplifting fable, a sort of fairy-story for adults. Nobody struggles with the ambiguities and complexities of real life in this film, and so the ""redemption"" it offers is false.As a point of comparison, take another film in this ""criminal redemption"" genre -- Dead Man Walking, a film, significantly, by Tom Robbins. Here is real, tough, moral drama. Can we forgive the Shawn Penn character? Is his redemption real? The film poses these questions without answering them. Plus the acting is rich and nuanced, the direction riveting. Dead Man Walking is much better film than Shawshank Redemption because it's about real life.";7;1;1;"This is not a bad film, and I would recommend renting it.

A good film;"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy everybody to watch it, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this, everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------";No rating;1;1;"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way.

Life has never been more beautiful!;This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners.

Very well but far from a masterpiece;Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10;7;2;1;Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie so powerful. Hope, life and friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature.

A Prison Story that will leave you wanting...;I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).Basically it's a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job?It's okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie:1 - The escape plan: It's silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you're expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It's roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts.;No rating;2;3;I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV.

Good, but great?;"Let me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film. It is perhaps one of the ultimate Hollywood feel-good movies. However, to call a film one of the greatest of all time, you need to compare it with many films of all types, and from many sources. This film is above average Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to most of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.I am suspicious of most film top 100's, 10's etc etc in any case. They are as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those voting than any intrinsic value of the film.Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film uniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human condition, would do better watching Sondeburgh's highly accessible, but more profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption ""Solaris"". The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian version!";5;3;4;"Let me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film.

Truly brilliant, moving and flawless.;I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it.

The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - Stephen King Got Me Hooked on this Movie!;"Stephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"". The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer ""Red"", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as ""Brooks"", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best movies ever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before, even though of it's slow 142 minute run-time.

10/10;"""The Shawshank Redemption"" stands as a cinematic masterpiece, weaving a tapestry of emotions, resilience, and redemption that resonates with audiences on a profound level. Released in 1994 and directed by Frank Darabont, this film has not only stood the test of time but has also solidified its place in the annals of cinema as one of the greatest works ever created.At its core, the film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" The narrative unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, where Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) finds himself serving a life sentence for a crime he vehemently denies committing. The plot meticulously navigates the harsh realities of prison life, exploring themes of friendship, institutionalization, and the indomitable human spirit.One of the film's most striking features is its impeccable storytelling. Darabont crafts a narrative that is both intricate and accessible, allowing viewers to connect with the characters on a deeply personal level. The storytelling is layered, with multiple threads weaving seamlessly together. The use of voiceover narration, delivered by Red (Morgan Freeman), adds a contemplative and reflective dimension, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.The film's pacing is another noteworthy aspect. Darabont takes his time to establish the characters and the prison environment, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in the world of Shawshank. The deliberate pacing also serves to heighten the impact of key moments, creating a visceral experience for the viewer. The film's nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime feels justified as every scene contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative.Central to the film's success is the stellar performances of its cast. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy Dufresne, capturing the character's quiet strength and unwavering determination. Morgan Freeman's performance as Red is equally remarkable, providing the film with its soul through his poignant narration and portrayal of a seasoned inmate with a keen understanding of the prison's dynamics.The supporting cast, including William Sadler as Heywood, Bob Gunton as the oppressive Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown as the menacing Captain Hadley, contribute to the film's authenticity. Each actor brings depth to their characters, making them more than mere archetypes and allowing the audience to empathize with their struggles and triumphs.The cinematography, spearheaded by Roger Deakins, is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual composition of each frame is meticulously crafted, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. The use of light and shadow is particularly noteworthy, symbolizing hope and despair respectively. From the sweeping shots of the prison yard to the intimate moments in Andy's cell, every scene is a visual feast that complements the storytelling.Thomas Newman's evocative score further elevates the film. The music seamlessly weaves through the narrative, underscoring the emotional beats with precision. The now-iconic theme, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" has become synonymous with the film itself, evoking a range of emotions from nostalgia to inspiration.Beyond its technical brilliance, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film with a profound message. At its core, it is a tale of resilience and the enduring power of hope. Andy's relentless pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement, even within the confines of Shawshank, serves as a testament to the human spirit's capacity to transcend adversity. The film inspires introspection, urging viewers to reflect on their own lives and the choices that define them.The theme of friendship is woven throughout the narrative, primarily through the bond between Andy and Red. This relationship serves as the emotional anchor of the film, illustrating how genuine connections can provide solace and strength even in the bleakest of circumstances. The camaraderie among the inmates, forged through shared hardship, adds another layer of depth to the film's exploration of human relationships.""The Shawshank Redemption"" also serves as a poignant critique of the prison system and the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization. Through the lens of Andy's experiences, the film sheds light on the arbitrary nature of justice and the challenges faced by those within the system. The corrupt practices within Shawshank, epitomized by Warden Norton, highlight the moral ambiguity that can permeate positions of authority.Furthermore, the film tackles themes of redemption and forgiveness. As the title suggests, Shawshank becomes a metaphorical crucible for redemption, where characters grapple with their past actions and seek a path to personal salvation. The conclusion of the film is a testament to the transformative power of redemption, offering a cathartic resolution that lingers in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends its prison setting to deliver a universal message of hope, friendship, and the indomitable nature of the human spirit.

I am in love with this movie! I have never seen such a heartbreaking and beautifully crafted movie such as this one.

It is a good film and i like it;"When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption"", which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is!

Freeman gives it depth;Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.;8;25;22;Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.

Incredibly moving, funny and haunting;Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.;10;4;1;Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation?

While this one is brilliant, I disagree. But that doesn't change the fact that it is an almost perfect film. The film is based on the book by Stephen King. And it proves once again that Stephen King is one of the best writers ever. The story is powerful and has a heavy impact on you. The emotion in this film is very present. The cast is perfectly chosen. They take this film to the next level. Morgan Freeman plays the stars from heaven. I can't believe this movie didn't even win many Oscars. This is one of my favourite movies ever and I just can't stop watching this.
Epic;Shawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.The movie (directed by Frank Darabont) takes a straight-forward, soul- searching novel by horror icon Stephen King and transforms it into a somber, bloated prison drama designed to fill you up with inspiration.Thanks to supreme performances and beautiful cinematography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame. And you get generous helpings of the novella's deft ironic humour about a inmate quietly turning a corrupt system against itself.A small box office release which made its name once released on home video, this movie is well worth a watch if you happened to have missed it first time around.;10;1;0;Shawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.

A film beyond greatness.;I have been into movies since, well I was 5. But after about 15 years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title. I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey! it ain't number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again.so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times.

A wonderfully constructed, emotional masterpiece;"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ****A man sets out to scratch together some semblance of a life after he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  With the inmates taking bets on which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment, the movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted murderer and the prison handyman.  With a growing trust and bond that will stand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new prisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision and determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying his professional experience within the prison.The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we expect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots with such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double quick time.  Rarely do I get the feeling that a movie was totally seamless, but this was one instance.  The acting was first rate, with both Robbins and Freeman putting in the performances of a lifetime.  I must admit I haven't see much of Robbins' work, but if all his other performances slump to deep mediocrity he will still be remembered for his part here.  Freeman was superb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that hope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect of a mans' character, whether inside or out.To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other outstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men that keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their sentences.  The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the obvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted.  But emerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal, hatred, anger and injustice.  So too was there joy and relief, and a new perspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously hadn't thought of.Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies I have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with freedom.  For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was deeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh insight into prison life.  It is a wonderfully crafted film, and whilst I hate banding extreme and blind accolades at movies that can be taken as fads, this will probably stay in my top five favourite movies for it's enjoyment, its direction and it's comprehensive grasp of so many of it's focus points.

My own personal view;"I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even better than Akira Kurosawa's Ran and One flew over the cuckoo's nest, which was my all time favorite until TSR came along.I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughts,""this must be the best film I've ever seen!"" But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best.In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.Hail Frank Darabont!";10;16;4;"I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film.

astonished;"This is what I'd call a ""very good"" film.

Awesome;"Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books.  When I first learned of them making a movie of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.

Greatest movie of all time!;This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see.

A Story Of Hope & Resilence;"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level.

Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either!

Scheme Of Hope;"""The Shawshank Redemption"" isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that ""salvation lies within."" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.""Hope can drive a man insane,"" Red warns Andy. ""It's got no use on the inside."" Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,"" it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film ""Harvey"" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (""fresh fish"") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.""Shawshank"" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that ""a warm place without memory"" is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told.

One of my all-time favourite movies;"What can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more.Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spirit.In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the mental patients.

Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved.";10;2;1;"What can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more. Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never lets prison break his spirit. In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the mental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character, full of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to ""teach them a lesson"". Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved."

My favorite movie was The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.;"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.So see it, buy it, love it.";8;3;2;"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.

Redeeming hope.;"I realise now that the immense praise that Shawshank receives - being number 1 on the IMDb list, nearly universal adoration and a cemented position as an iconic classic - is all completely deserved.I had been wanting to watch The Shawshank Redemption for a couple years, and once I did it blew me away. I even wanted to watch it again today, just a day after, and relive this movie again and the joy it gave me.I've gotten used to watching very subpar, modern movies but this was a movie that deeply moved me - it tells the story of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongly jailed for a crime he didn't commit, and illustrates his life over the next 20 years, and the unforgettable characters he meets along the way. It is a movie about friendship in its purest and simplest forms.Shawshank is a gem because it makes you think - but about things what will be unique to you: about yourself, life, and what you make of its ephemerality, (or power, corruption and the justice system). It evokes visceral emotion in you: empathy, love: you will root for the main characters and feel a growing bond with them through the 2 hours and 22 minutes, almost as if you are an inmate and a friend in Shawshank yourself; it will make you laugh and make you cry.The script is genuinely beautifully written, and several times throughout I thought to myself how it often sounded like poetry. Morgan Freeman in particular delivers an amazing, sensitive performance through both his narration and acting, and the rest of the cast are equally as essential and perfect for their characters, with rich visuals and cinematography bringing the camaraderie and encapsulating the mood in Shawshank to life respectively.This movie will bring you hope, which may be a dangerous thing, but which also may be the best of things - as well as something that we all quite possibly need now, today, more than ever.Sorry for writing such a long review and thank you for reading.

Captivating, breathtaking and compelling...;"The Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. You simply will never find a better film, ever.The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and lover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to life in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately befriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison itself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals. After a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the help of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the prison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob Gunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax fraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is ""friends"" with the officials.I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture, but believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him gives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up. The cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You will find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad times and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise twist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally breathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters, felt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters, loathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest certain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is.

Robbed at the Academy Awards;By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.;10;5;3;By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars... Forrest Gump.

Excellent! Beaware of Inst-man-cry.;This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.;10;1;0;This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watching in sync with friends.

A fantasy indeed.;The popularity of this film seems to stem with the current emotional appeals and issues of today, just as Citizen Kane seemed to do when it was revived. What makes Citizen Kane more appealing to me though is the abundance of creativity in telling the story.If you want a highly emotional experience, I would watch this movie. Since I am for more intelligent and unpredictable type films, I am not one for movies like this.And if I would explain the movie in one sentence, I would say it is a classic cinema soap opera, perfectly crafted to emotionally stimulate movie viewers, in order for them to hold certain perspectives on societal issues.;7;4;5;The popularity of this film seems to stem with the current emotional appeals and issues of today, just as Citizen Kane seemed to do when it was revived.

A movie beyond words,loved it !!;This is my 1st review on IMDb , i don't like writing reviews for a movie after all it's just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon, well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like Morgan free-man you'll love of him after this one....

Best movie ever;"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script.Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.";10;1;0;"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.

On of the Best Movies;"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on ""movie magic,"" but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences.";No rating;1;0;"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation.

Good but not great;The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.;5;3;4;The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie.

the best movie ever;the movie is life changer Out of any film that has ever been made, this is my far the best one. It's just so special and moving. Such a deep and touching message about life and the institutionalization aspects of prison life. It really touches the inner hopefulness in all of us, or at least everyone who has seen this movie. If you've never seen it, watch it,;10;1;0;The movie is life changing. Out of any film that has ever been made, this is my far best one. It's just so special and moving.

It doesn't feel like a movie but an emotional roller coaster ride.;How can a prison story be this deep, you are what you choose. Andy is an intelligent and steadfast man, Mr Red is an old man with Regret. I broke in tears twice while watching this movie, one time in the mid and other at the end. I didn't expect it to be such a masterpiece that exceeded expectations.At first I thought I'm watching a typical Prison story but the interactions, the ideas, emotions filled inside just that. You Always think that you are not in the right place and should go to that place where you wish to be but think about it, if you really went to that place you'll feel empty inside.;10;1;0;How can a prison story be this deep?
